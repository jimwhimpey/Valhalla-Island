<a href="https://www.panic.com/sale/"><img src="/assets/tumblr/oaQecruTZnzapxb667MXBQX5o1_500.png"/></a><br/><p>Panic, craftsmen of great Mac software are <a href="https://www.panic.com/sale/">cutting their major app prices in half</a> for just three days. I use CandyBar and Transmit constantly and love them both. Coda hasn&#8217;t suited my workflow before but in pursuit of better process at work it&#8217;s obvious Coda fits perfectly. My trial runs out at the end of the week, it&#8217;s the ideal time to buy Panic&#8217;s most expensive app.</p>
