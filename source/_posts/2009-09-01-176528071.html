For two weeks starting from today every $10 you donate to my <a href="http://ride.jimwhimpey.com/">Ride to Cure</a> Type 1 Diabetes fundraising campaign gets you the chance to win one of two great Mac software bundles worth almost $200 each! JDRF&#8217;s fundraising website lists donors and amounts so you know exactly how good your chances are. It&#8217;s no half assed bundle either, that&#8217;s 7&#160;<em>quality</em> applications from reputable developers.</p>
