[YoJimbo](http://www.barebones.com/products/yojimbo/) has been part of my Mac experience since I started university where I used it to take notes during class on my 12" PowerBook.

When I got a second Mac YoJimbo was the only reason I shelled out $120/year for a MobileMe subscription. The MobileMe sync worked really well for years until it ceased to work behind my work's network (not YoJimbo's fault). Then iCloud superseded MobileMe and choosing to migrate meant giving up YoJimbo sync. We're now [four days from the MobileMe sunset](http://www.apple.com/mobileme/) with [no sign](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/yojimbo-talk/V9ICS1u4ins) of [the promised](http://barebones.com/support/yojimbo/faqs.html#icloud) iCloud sync supporting update to YoJimbo

Meanwhile, there's been the iPhone and the iPad. How do you get your YoJimbo content on those devices? I briefly tried [WebJimbo](http://flyingmac.com/webjimbo/) but found it buggy, messy and could never get it to work quite right.

Bare Bones partially filled the gap with [Sidekick](http://www.barebones.com/products/yojimbo/tour-sidekick.html) which, if you were able to mount a remote server or publicly reveal a local web server (being careful to password protect the directory) you could access your data remotely. This is pretty good but with the minor downside no offline viewing and the major downside of read only data.

For the iPad there's a slightly better solution, [an official YoJimbo app](http://www.barebones.com/products/mobile/yojimbo/)! Unfortunately it only syncs via the manual open-both-apps-while-you're-on-the-same-network method. Without remembering to open the app before leaving your network you're left with an out of date copy of your data, a disadvantage compared to Sidekick but with the advantage of offline viewing. Again though, your data is frustratingly read only.

Enter: Evernote.

In my usual style I ignored Evernote while everyone raved about it. I wanted to use the office iPad for taking notes at my French class. I needed something I could log into and out of with this not being my iPad and something I could easily and *automatically* get my data out of. Evernote fit the bill.

Soon after I got an iPad of my own and didn't like the thought of continuing to persevere with a $10 read-only, manual syncing YoJimbo client and I switched.

Transferring my data out was as simple as creating equivalent notebooks in Evernote and simply dragging my items across. All notes maintained their formatting and things like software serials converted to YoJimbo's plain text export format. It took no time at all.

I'll miss being able to apply custom icons to folders/notebooks, I'll really miss colour labels but I definitely won't miss applying [a hack to get a three vertical pane view](http://hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/widescreen-hack-for-yojimbo-2) after every update for 7 years.
