<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/compare/pc-vs-mac.aspx">Mac vs. PC by Microsoft</a></p><p>Observations:</p>



<ul><li>The centrepiece of the page is stock photography.</li>

<li>&#8220;Working hard&#8221; is one of their selling points.</li>

<li>&#8220;Macs can take time to learn&#8221;.</li>

<li>Three of the six areas mention Office incompatibilities, software Microsoft also releases for the Mac.</li>

<li>Lots of &#8220;mays&#8221; and &#8220;mights&#8221;. Nothing substantiated, just planting seeds of doubt.</li>

</ul><p>The difference in each campaign embodies the difference in each company on the whole. Apple sell the Mac&#8217;s advantages, Microsoft sell the Mac&#8217;s potential disadvantages. Offence vs. defence.</p>



<p>Beside that, the whole thing is just full of inaccuracies or exaggerations designed to scare:</p>



<ul><li>&#8220;And Macs can&#8217;t connect to an Xbox 360&#8221;. I connect to my Xbox from my iMac almost daily.</li>

<li>&#8221;[&#8230;] the mouse works differently&#8221;. Not true.</li>

<li>&#8220;With a Mac, it&#8217;s harder to set up secure sharing for your photos, music &amp; movies, documents, and even printers with other computers on your home network.&#8221; Not true.</li>

<li>&#8220;On a Mac, you have to manually set up photo sharing, manually set up music and movie sharing, manually set up file sharing, and manually set up printer sharing.&#8221; That&#8217;s true, each involves clicking a check box.</li>

</ul>
