<p>I couldn&#8217;t believe it this morning watching 7 Early News that <a href="http://www.forbes.com/2009/11/08/iphone-virus-attack-technology-security-rickrolling-cybersecurity.html">this</a> was being reported as an iPhone virus with no more qualification than that. It requires three things:</p>



<ol><li>A jail broken phone.</li>

<li>OpenSSH installed, not a default on most jail broken phones.</li>

<li>The default root password.</li>

</ol><p>So about 0.1% of iPhones whose users have gone out of their way to open up completely but haven&#8217;t taken the care to change their password are susceptible. Meanwhile every iPhone owner is under the impression their phones are vulnerable.</p>



<p>Don&#8217;t let the truth get in the way of a good story. Not that anyone having their iPhone background set to a picture of Rick Astley is a good story.</p>
