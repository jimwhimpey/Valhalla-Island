<blockquote>After you&#8217;ve been running for 8+ hours every little thing becomes an incredible luxury; at mile 21 I drank a cup of flat Mountain Dew and I swear it tasted like unicorn tears. At mile 43 I ate a PB&amp;J sandwich and it was like eating the entrails of a fallen angel.</blockquote><p><a href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics">The Oatmeal&#8217;s</a> Matthew Inman <a href="http://theoatmeal.com/blog/ultramarathon">ran an ultra marathon</a>.</p>



<p>This is one of my favourite things about road cycling. At the end of a tough 6 or 7 hour ride you revert to your most basic instincts. Food, drink and rest become all you can think about and indulging them feels like the highest satisfaction you will ever achieve.</p>
