<p>There are basically two supermarket options in Australia: Woolworths and Coles. In every suburb they&#8217;re within walking distance of each other so the decision of which to shop at usually falls to what you grew up with. Usually you&#8217;re a Coles person or a Woolworths person and the other just feels weird.</p>



<p>I grew up shopping at Woolworths and couldn&#8217;t imagine shopping at Coles. Until I did and really liked it for a number of reasons. The latest place I&#8217;m living sits exactly half way between a Woolworths and a Coles. For a couple of months I&#8217;ve been alternating between the two. These are my findings:</p>



<ul><li>Banks charge ridiculous fees for EFTPOS transactions. One way around it is to get a debit card and make EFTPOS transactions as though it&#8217;s a credit card. The money still comes out of your savings or checking account but the fee is moved from you to the retailer. Woolworths obviously weren&#8217;t happy about being charged a few cents every $100+ transaction so they stopped people doing it a few months ago. Coles still allows it just as almost every other store does. +1 Coles.</li>

<li>Woolworths have installed self service checkouts and dramatically reduced checkout staff numbers. The self service checkouts are a huge pain in the ass to use for anything but one or two items. Even at quiet times checking out at Woolworths involves standing in a long line. Coles are the opposite, they have no self service checkouts and lots of staff with usually no waiting in line at all. +1 Coles.</li>

<li>Coles has dedicated bicycle parking, Woolworths does not. +1 Coles.</li>

<li>The plastic produce bags at Coles are thick and never break. Woolworths are thin and often tear when removing them from the spindle or putting bananas in at the wrong angle. It&#8217;s small but it makes a difference. +1 Coles.</li>

<li>Coles have a special kind of small trolley that&#8217;s much bigger than a basket but smaller and raised higher than a regular trolley. For someone like me shopping for one it&#8217;s perfect, everything fits easily and I don&#8217;t need to bend all way over to fill and empty it. Woolworths just have small baskets and huge trollies. +1 Coles.</li>

<li>Woolworths have a rewards program and card. I realise that this is a blatant lock-in trap and that I&#8217;ll probably have to spend $10,000 before I get any kind of reward back but I have to buy food so I figure I may as well be accumulating <em>something</em>. Coles also have a program but it&#8217;s tied to a frequent flyer program for which I&#8217;ll rarely reap the benefits. +1 Woolworths.</li>

<li>Woolworths has spent money on creating a nice ambiance, the lighting is good, displays not too crass and the aisles are wide. Coles haven&#8217;t put the same work into ambiance. +1 Woolworths.</li>

<li>I can get everything I like at Woolworths, Coles is missing a number of things that I like. +1 Woolworths.</li>

</ul><p>The things Woolworths does at the expense of my time and money does not result in cheaper prices. I can barely tell the difference between the two in price. Coles is the clear winner but with its range issue for things I like it means I either need to make an additional trip to Woolworths each week or start eating differently.</p>
