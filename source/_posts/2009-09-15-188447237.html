title: "Frustrating Finance"
---

<p>No matter how impulsively I&#8217;m spending my money, as long as I&#8217;m keeping track of where it&#8217;s going, how much I have left and when more is likely to come in, I never feel out of control. This is why I&#8217;ve invested so much time in <a href="http://www.midnightapps.com/chaching/">Cha-Ching</a>, an increasingly frustrating endeavour.</p>



<p>Finance is the slum category of Mac software. The <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/business_finance/">options</a> are ugly, overflowing with superfluous features, completely ignore convention, lack polish and are plain un-Mac-like. Cha-Ching is the best of a horrible bunch and even it has glaring issues, I&#8217;ve written about one <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/91062909">particularly frustrating &#8220;feature&#8221;</a> before.</p>



<p>Recently I&#8217;ve decided to get a little more serious about my finance management and organise my income and expenditures properly. This is ridiculously difficult in Cha-Ching. Some of my issues:</p>



<ul><li>Cha-Ching provides a huge list of default categories, some broad, some obscure, only a few of which I want to use. You can add and remove your own categories but you cannot modify the default list. Your own custom categories are presented beneath the defaults making selecting a category needlessly tedious.</li>

<li>Tagging behaviour works unlike anything I&#8217;ve used <em>anywhere</em> before. If you&#8217;ve previously entered a lowercase tag, <em>even if you delete the tag and the entry it was attached to</em>, it is <em>impossible</em> to enter the same tag in title case. There&#8217;s so many tiny behavioural oddities in the tags field it&#8217;s hard to articulate what&#8217;s wrong with it.</li>

<li>The image selector laboriously forces you to scroll through an unnecessarily small field of images before dragging the image onto a drop zone. A search box is provided but simply doesn&#8217;t work in my experience. Not only is it a very strange way of labelling an entry with an image but it&#8217;s super buggy, the image list scroll area is full of empty images and duplicates. Additionally there is no option to assign an image to an entire category or assign them to scheduled transactions.</li>

<li>Custom drop down boxes do not accept tab focus and cannot be controlled by keyboard, adding to the extremely slow process of adding or editing data.</li>

<li>Custom buttons have no keyboard shortcuts and also don&#8217;t accept tab focus.</li>

<li>Scheduled transactions need to be manually &#8220;paid&#8221; to appear in your transaction lists rendering them almost completely useless. A plain text list of scheduled transactions would do the job almost as well.</li>

</ul><p>In it&#8217;s defence Cha-Ching is officially a &#8220;beta&#8221; application but when you&#8217;re at the 2.0 release and no longer offering the 1.0 a beta label smells much less like pre-release software and much more like a scapegoat.</p>



<p>What frustrates me most about this list is that they all relate directly to <em>storing your financial data</em>, the single piece of functionality a finance application needs to get right. Meanwhile Cha-Ching features a to do list manager, a companion iPhone app and a fucking <em>web browser</em>.</p>



<p>Cha-Ching has a solid base, there&#8217;s relatively little it needs to fix to become a great Mac application. In a few cases problems would be solved by simply using system default controls rather than custom ones. Yet core functionality remains half done and unpolished while almost-totally-unrelated-to-finance features are added equally half heartedly.</p>
