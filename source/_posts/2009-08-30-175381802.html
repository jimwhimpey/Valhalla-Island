title: "Minimal Mac's Menu Bar Vendetta"
---

<p>Almost once a day <a href="http://minimalmac.com/">Minimal Mac</a> features a post about how to cut stuff out of your menu bar. The most common removal is the time and date, then replaced by <a href="http://www.machinecodex.com/dateline/index.php">DateLine</a>, a timeline style calendar that sits permanently on and spans the entire desktop. How that scores more minimalism points than the current date a click away in the menu bar, iCal or the dashboard, I don&#8217;t know.</p>



<p>Beside that, applications running in the menu bar has got to be the most unobtrusive, &#8216;minimalist&#8217; option. I&#8217;ve seen unwieldy menu bars but the problem isn&#8217;t the menu bar, it&#8217;s running unused applications. Hiding the dock? Easy. Getting every icon off your desktop? Easy. Minimal Mac&#8217;s assault on the menu bar is minimalism for the sake of minimalism at the expense of utility and convenience.</p>
