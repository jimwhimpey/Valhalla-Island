<p>I hate this vigilante journalism, the-media-is-lying-to-you bullshit from people with a copy of Flash, a microphone and a week alone in their bedroom.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s his premise without the lame jokes and superfluous animation:</p>



<ol><li>Somali pirates hijack ships at gunpoint, receive a ransom and leave.</li>

<li>The media reports this.</li>

<li>Foreigners ditch nuclear waste <em>and</em> overfish Somalia&#8217;s waters.</li>

<li>The media doesn&#8217;t mention this when reporting on pirate attacks.</li>

<li>So who&#8217;s the <em>real</em> bad guys?!</li>

</ol><p>Yeah, committing a crime against an innocent company and group of people is justified when a totally unrelated group of people pollute and overfish your waters. According to this guy, it&#8217;s not only justified but the pirates are the <em>good guys</em>.</p>



<p>Then the <em>terrible</em> media only reports the pirate attacks without going in depth on every story relating to Somalia and the whole continent it belongs to.</p>



<p>The mainstream media sucks in a lot of ways, this isn&#8217;t one of them.</p>
