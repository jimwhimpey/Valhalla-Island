title: Defining My Problem with Retweeting and a Certain Kind of Reblogging
---

<p>It&#8217;s regurgitation, nothing more. I understand the noble desire to attribute but copying someone else&#8217;s post verbatim is less attribution, more mindless duplication.</p>



<p>If you like something someone&#8217;s said, give it a star, it&#8217;s built right into Twitter. If you like it more than a single star can express and you just <em>have</em> to share it with the world, link to it, it&#8217;s built right into the internet. Link to it and say why, add something of your own, add something <em>original</em>.</p>



<p>I make an effort to not follow people who retweet, those who don&#8217;t must have streams filled with constant repetition of not only the same information but the <em>exact same words</em>. It&#8217;s got to feel like a mail client that delivers every email five times over.</p>



<p>Reblogging in Tumblr is great for linking posts that respond or add on each other. I use it often when quoting a passage from a post or linking to the same thing someone else has. I always add my own thought, it&#8217;s the only reason I&#8217;m reblogging at all, without it, reblogging is duplication, just redundant data in a database.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s abused. Popular posts have a string of nested &#8220;quotes&#8221; that contain nothing more than the name of another copycat.</p>
