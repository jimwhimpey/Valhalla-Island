For many niches interacting with forum software is the only option. There&#8217;s few easier ways to start a community. There&#8217;s 1000s of options, all trying to out feature the next when less, much less, is what&#8217;s desperately required.</p>



<p>The less phpBBs, Agoras, Simple Machines (the world&#8217;s most ironically named piece of software) and the more <a href="http://vanillaforums.org/">Vanillas</a> the better.</p>
