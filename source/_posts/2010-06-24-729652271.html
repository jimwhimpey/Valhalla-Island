title: "New Flickr Photo Pages"

<p><a href="http://blog.flickr.net/en/2010/06/23/a-new-photo-experience-your-photos-happier/">New Flickr Photo Pages</a></p><p>For six years Flickr has had the same frustratingly insufficient photo pages and navigation between them. Two months after I <a href="http://darkroom.heroku.com">create my own thing to address the problem</a> Flickr fixes every issue natively. Albeit currently as an opt-in beta.</p>



<p>At first I wasn&#8217;t worried, the default size was still too small and navigation was still too slow. Then I saw the incredible zoom option with big photos, dark background, super fast keyboard navigation and loading times. It completely blows Darkroom away and it&#8217;s available on every kind of Flickr output.</p>



<p>My happiness as a Flickr user outweighs my disappointment as Darkroom developer.</p>



<p>C&#8217;est la vie.</p>
