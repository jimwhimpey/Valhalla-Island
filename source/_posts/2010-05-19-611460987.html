<blockquote>The Subaru system, called Eyesight, uses two stereo cameras mounted at the top of the windscreen to study the road, cars, bicycles and pedestrians to avoid collisions.</blockquote>&#8212;<p>Stephen Ottley reporting for the The Age on <a href="http://theage.drive.com.au/motor-news/the-cyclistfriendly-car-20100518-vboc.html">Subaru&#8217;s new pedestrian and cyclist friendly car</a>.</p>



<p>As a road riding cyclist who&#8217;s been hit by a car, this cyclist &#8220;friendly&#8221; car scares me. It does nothing but remove the onus for concentrating on the road from drivers already not paying enough attention.</p>



<p>The system has some nice practical applications though:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>It can also detect if the car ahead has taken off at the traffic lights and give the driver a reminder audio warning to start driving.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>and:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Eyesight can detect if the driver accidentally selects &#8216;Drive&#8217; instead of reverse and limit the amount of power delivered to the wheels.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Great, a stopgap for stupidity! No longer is stupidity an obstacle when it comes to controlling a high powered, three ton chuck of steel.</p>



<p>New from Oakley: sunglasses which provide an audible warning if they&#8217;re accidentally put on upside down or on the wrong side of your head.</p>
