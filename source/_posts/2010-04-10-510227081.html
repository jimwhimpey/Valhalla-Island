<blockquote>Giving it away is a weird choice. Are there people who would use Twitter, if only they could afford a mobile client app?</blockquote><p><a href="http://twitter.com/siracusa/status/11913825397">John Siracusa</a> in response to the news <a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2010/04/twitter-for-iphone.html">Twitter has bought Tweetie for iPhone and is making it free</a>.</p>



<p>The whole thing feels weird to me. Why would Loren Brichter abandon his massively successful independently run <a href="http://www.atebits.com/">business</a>, the freedom and control that comes with it to be another cog in the Twitter machine? It&#8217;d be a different story if Tweetie was languishing in obscurity but it&#8217;s got to be the most popular Twitter  iPhone <em>and</em> Mac client. I guess they gave him a bag of money too big to refuse.</p>



<p>It&#8217;ll be interesting to see what happens to Tweetie for Mac, my favourite Twitter desktop client.</p>
