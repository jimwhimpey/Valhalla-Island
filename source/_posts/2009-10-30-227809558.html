<a href="http://solidbase.tumblr.com"><img src="/assets/tumblr/tumblr_ksbnt0HMnG1qzwfbio1_500.png"/></a><br/><p><a href="http://solidbase.tumblr.com">A Solid Base</a> is my attempt at the trend of using Tumblr not to write or share things you&#8217;ve made but to curate a niche of great things <em>others</em> have made. It&#8217;s my favourite, hand picked desktop wallpaper always at high resolution. It&#8217;s kind of like <a href="http://prettify.tumblr.com/">Prettify</a> and <a href="http://www.iconpaper.org/">Iconpaper</a> but without the icons and without all the wallpaper I don&#8217;t like.</p>



<p>I know if you&#8217;re using your computer properly it should rarely be seen but desktop wallpaper is still important. There&#8217;s a lot of great stuff out there but it&#8217;s buried in a sea of rubbish, A Solid Base is your filter. I&#8217;ve loaded it up with a bunch to begin with and have many more lined up in the queue. Enjoy and submit, if you like.</p>
