<p>Earth Hour exists so that people who do nothing can feel like they&#8217;re doing something. Drive home from work in your 4X4, turn on the air conditioning, watch programs on your massive TV, leave it on while you have a 30 minute shower, turn off your lights for an hour, feel good about the <em>real difference you&#8217;re making to the environment</em>.</p>



<p>An advertisement in the local paper read: &#8220;Join the Redland City Council as it turns off all non-essential lighting for Earth Hour&#8221;. How about turning off <strong>non-essential</strong> lighting all the time?</p>
