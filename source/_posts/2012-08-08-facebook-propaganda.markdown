Reddit user mr17five does [a great job tearing down](http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/xtl8k/is_not_joining_facebook_a_sign_youre_a_psychopath/c5ptvyk) a terrible article [from the Daily Mail](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2184658/Is-joining-Facebook-sign-youre-psychopath-Some-employers-psychologists-say-suspicious.html?ICO=most_read_module) about the way not being on Facebook makes you a potential psychopath:

> The article sets out to immediately assert that facebook is "such a pervasive force in modern society" that it would almost be foolish not to have one. This is known as [argumentum ad populum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum), or more commonly "bandwagon fallacy." Just ignore the fact that over six billion people (over 85% of Earth's population) do not have facebook accounts.

A subset of the world's mass murderers also didn't drink a litre of beetroot juice for breakfast. If you don't drink a litre of beetroot juice for breakfast "some" "experts" "might" think that you "could be" a "psychopath".
