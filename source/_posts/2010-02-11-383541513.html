title: "Prefabricated Housing"
---

<p>I <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/271313749">think a lot</a> about the kind of place I want to live and recently I&#8217;ve been watching Trailer Park Boys (an unlikely great show). It occurred to me that the kind of demountable trailers you find in a trailer park closely fits my ideal.</p>



<p>The entire concept of a trailer park appeals to me: small cheap lots, small cheap homes, no fences, plenty of shared areas and community spirit. It&#8217;s a shame they&#8217;re almost exclusively limited to petty criminals living on the poverty line. I&#8217;d move into one today if I wasn&#8217;t sure my TV, computer and bike would be stolen within a week. I stereotype, but still.</p>



<p>Prefabricated housing is more substantial than a trailer and right at home outside of a trailer park. They offer everything I want:</p>



<ul><li>One or two bedrooms, all I need.</li>

<li>A small footprint that can be dropped on a relatively small (and therefore cheaper) block still leaving room for a backyard and shed.</li>

<li>Environmentally conscious design to make the best use of little energy or solely make use of natural energy.</li>

<li>A focus on large outdoor areas and openings.</li>

<li>and they&#8217;re cheap, less than $100,000 for one or two bedrooms.</li>

</ul><p>Find a small block close to the city for $150,000 or less, drop a prefab house on it for $100,000 and you&#8217;ve got yourself a brand new, standalone and <em>cheap</em> home with a backyard for a third of the price of a traditional house. I don&#8217;t know why they&#8217;re not more common.</p>
