title: "Quicken Essentials for Mac"

<p>Since giving up on the frustratingly incomplete <a href="http://www.midnightapps.com/chaching/">Cha-Ching</a> months ago with no attractive alternative I have simply not been managing my money. Quicken was the last developer I expected to come to my rescue but after a few hours with <a href="http://quicken.intuit.com/">Quicken Essentials for Mac</a> I&#8217;m surprised to find it nails my personal requirements.</p>



<p>They are:</p>



<ul><li>Fast data entry. An entry can be made super quickly using only the keyboard. Vital for consistently completing what is a chore.</li>

<li>A 100% customisable categorisation system. You&#8217;re provided you with a default set but it can be replaced with your own. This was one of my biggest frustrations with Cha-Ching.</li>

<li>Representation of upcoming scheduled transactions in the regular transaction list. At a glance you can see not only how much you have <em>right now</em> but how much you&#8217;re expecting to have in the near future. Also a simple way to keep upcoming expenses on the radar. Better yet, the future buffer period is configurable.</li>

<li>The concept of reconciled transactions. My ideal workflow is adding transactions as I make them before reconciling a bunch of transactions with my bank statement once every week or so.</li>

<li>Online integration must be fantastic for those who want it but nothing integrates with my obscure building society and I don&#8217;t want it to anyway. If my financial situation ever becomes so complex I can&#8217;t feasibly enter each transaction and reconcile the account manually something else has to change. For those who don&#8217;t want it, online integration stays out of the way in Quicken Essentials.</li>

<li>Maximum use of native UI widgets. Other OS X finance applications try too hard to be cute at the expense of clarity and usability.</li>

</ul><p>As for downsides there&#8217;s an extremely sparse list of preferences. If Quicken wasn&#8217;t notorious for lack of software updates I&#8217;d suggest it&#8217;s no big deal for a first release.</p>



<p>The model of creating a user managed file to store data is used which usually bothers me a great deal for a library style app like Essentials. Although everything is done to make the model invisible to a user with the file automatically created in the Documents directory, no save function whatsoever and autoloading of the last open file which makes it a non-issue but I do wonder why they can&#8217;t just create the same file in ~/Library, out of sight.</p>



<p>They&#8217;ve obviously tried hard to go native with the UI but some quirks remain like these awkward dividers between accounts in the source list:</p>

<p>Other categories in the source list don&#8217;t have them, they&#8217;re plain unnecessary. That said, kudos to Quicken for using a traditional source list at all. Then there&#8217;s the inline transaction creator which functions beautifully but just feels <em>weird</em>:</p>

<p>If some small UI quirks are all I&#8217;ve got to complain about Quicken have done a great job,  it feels great to be managing my money again.</p>
