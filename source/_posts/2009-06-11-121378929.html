<p>It&#8217;s been 4 weeks since signing up for <a href="http://iinet.net.au/naked-dsl/plans.html">iiNet Naked DSL</a>, my connection has been activated and my iiNet approved, brand new, $200 modem and router has arrived. I still don&#8217;t have access to the internet.</p>



<p>Another half an hour call to iiNet last night and it&#8217;s been narrowed down to my modem/router not functioning properly or the line to my apartment being dead. The modem is with a workmate to rule out whether it&#8217;s broken. Then I can call to get a work order created to fix the line into my apartment, which will take at least a week from the time the work order is confirmed.</p>



<p>This whole thing is getting beyond ridiculous, I chose Naked DSL because it doesn&#8217;t require a phone line thus cutting another company and step out of the process and supposedly <em>simplifying things</em>. At this point it looks like it&#8217;d take less time to totally cancel my month old Naked DSL application (which is apparently now active), sign up for a phone line and a standard ADSL2 plan with a different company.</p>
