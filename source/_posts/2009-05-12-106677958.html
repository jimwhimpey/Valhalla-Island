<a href="http://haveabeagle.tumblr.com/">Have a Beagle and Carry On</a><br/><p>Despite Tumblr&#8217;s focus on publishing different kinds of media in varied formats, it&#8217;s so often the one subject, one format streams like <a href="http://haveabeagle.tumblr.com/">Have a Beagle</a> that make the best tumble blogs. Our <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jimwhimpey/2597562334/">two pups</a> would make great post candidates.</p>



<p>As a sidenote, Have a Beagle&#8217;s theme by <a href="http://autumn.welles.name/">Autumn Welles</a> is one of the best I&#8217;ve seen.</p>
