> Seems to me that Kickstarter is the most important tech company since Facebook. Maybe more important in the long run.

I'd say [Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/), a service which completely turns the table on product development, artistic endeavours, innovation and brings new meaning to the whole concept of supply and demand, is *definitely* more important than Facebook, a service which facilitates friends chatting and sharing photos.

What is *important* about Facebook? What's it brought us that didn't exist before or wouldn't have existed otherwise? Nothing but Zynga that I can think of.
