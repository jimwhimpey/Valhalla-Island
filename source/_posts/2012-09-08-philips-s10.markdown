Your challenge is to design a phone handset ideal for one thing: holding it to your ear and having a verbal conversation. A sharp-edged, rectangle brick is not the ideal design for this purpose. It's dainty and uncomfortable. [This](http://www.macworld.com/article/1151569/yubz.html) is seriously better.

Where the small, sharp-edged, rectangle brick does work is as a mobile device you carry everywhere. You never have to carry your landline handset outside of a phone call, optimising the design for that purpose is crazy. I argue that the sharp-edged rectangle brick isn't even ideal for a mobile device; the previous curved back iPhone felt more comfortable in hand and the newer iPhone 4 and 4S choose looks over physical comfort. A perfectly fine compromise to make.

But who cares? The iPhone is successful, ignore the context and just copy it! I give it a year until we see iPhone "inspired" garage door openers and light switches.
