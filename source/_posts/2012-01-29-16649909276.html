<blockquote>

  <p>At a get-together of home schoolers in a suburban park in Brisbane, one mother, Cindy, said she was about to start home schooling her son but was afraid of the paperwork involved.</p>

  

  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not planning (on registering) because of the work involved,&#8221; she said.</p>

  

  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not very organised and disciplined in that sense so that would be a big thing for me to undertake.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wow.</p>
