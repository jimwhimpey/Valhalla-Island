<blockquote>The worst part about it that it’s not even a physical limit; it’s an arbitrary number that the developers picked, just because.</blockquote>&#8212;<p><a href="http://prethoughtlisten.tumblr.com/post/98870923/every-windows-user-i-know-has-the-its-not-that">Ryan McCue</a> in response to <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/98852350">my previous post on the subject</a>.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m certain it&#8217;s not the developers that made this decision but the managers or sales team or marketing department, it could have been anyone, <em>just not the developers</em>. This has got to be a case of developers tearing their hair out in frustration, arguing against the stupidity of an arbitrary application limit, <em>knowing</em> it&#8217;s wrong, feeling sick while writing the code to make it work but having no stake whatsoever in the decision.</p>
