I've recently been building an HTML email newsletter at work. Getting an HTML email to work across the many [extremely limited](http://www.campaignmonitor.com/css/) and broken email clients makes IE6 debugging look like fin. I truly don't think HTML email is worth the effort but that's another story.

It meant I needed to get a Hotmail account for testing. The first time I'd used Hotmail in 6 or 7 years. As a regular iCloud webmail user I found what I think is a nice example of the difference between Apple and Microsoft at the screens shown immediately after logging in:

I remember as a teenager using Windows before I switched to the Mac getting frustrated about these kinds of UIs and Windows' inexplicable popularity despite it. It feels great to have watched better persist and [better eventually win](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=MSFT%2C+AAPL).
