<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHlN21ebeak&amp;hd=1">Windows Phone 7 Commercial</a><br/><p>As far as simply enjoying a video goes I <em>love</em> this commercial from Microsoft. It beautifully ridicules a phenomenon that really annoys me and that I&#8217;m ever conscious of <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/737271650">avoiding personally</a>. But as a sales pitch for a phone? <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/garrettmurray/status/27074080635">Garrett Murray</a>:</p>

  <p>Point of new Windows 7 Phone commercials seems to be &#8220;Tired of that phone you love using all the time? You won&#8217;t wanna use ours that much.&#8221;</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a great commercial for being present and connected to the physical world around you rather than for a phone.</p>



<p>Compare with the <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/gallery/ads.html#ad-every">iPhone ads</a> which show nothing but the phone in use.</p>
