<p>For every Facebook photoset showing off 21st birthday parties full of people who shared the same primary school 10 years earlier but haven&#8217;t had much to do with each other since or a hired out community hall elaborately decorated but not full of many people at all, I feel further vindicated by my decision to skip having my own 21st birthday party all together.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t like birthday parties to begin with. I&#8217;d rather celebrate real achievements or celebrate for no reason at all than congratulate myself for staying alive while time has passed. Birthday parties feel like organised attention seeking and make me feel like I&#8217;m cheating. Twenty firsts are everything I hate about birthday parties multiplied.</p>
