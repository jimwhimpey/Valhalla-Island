In a world of where online news success is measured by advertising impressions the newly launched [Global Mail](http://www.theglobalmail.org/) is taking a refreshingly scrupulous approach. Funded by philanthropy, run by an edict to serve the audience, not advertisers, staffed by many ex-ABC journalists who publish only a few articles each day.

The design is interesting: horizontal scrolling with article body text split into thin newspaper-like thin columns. For articles where I can easily sideways scroll with a trackpad or iPad touch screen I think it works really well. On the homepage where you can only navigate sideways with buttons it's clunky. The Twitter ticker along the bottom of the homepage is gratuitous.

From what I've read so far the writing is top notch. I really enjoyed Mike Seccombe's piece on [the cultural differences between Australian and American sport](http://www.theglobalmail.org/feature/why-the-super-bowl-is-a-super-bore/15/). All in all this is very close to the news website I'd create myself in an ideal world.
