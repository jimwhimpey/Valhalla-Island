title: "The Steve Jobs Biography"
---

<p>Previously I only knew vague details of Apple&#8217;s history so I learnt a great deal. Steve Jobs was truly and genius and his life is inspirational to me beyond words. I share many of values in almost all areas but don&#8217;t live them with anywhere near the same extreme conviction. The book has inspired me to live with more. It also further instilled the value of focus, <em>laser beam focus</em>.</p>



<p>Yes, he was a jerk but it&#8217;s been to the <em>benefit of humanity</em>. Shit work walks out the door every day because feelings can&#8217;t be hurt or diplomacy needs to be maintained. This is a terrible tradeoff. If more shit was called as it is the world would be a better place.</p>



<p>The details of the Sculley saga are bizarre with the way Jobs completely manipulated him to his own detriment. At least in the short to medium term. I doubt everything that happened with Sculley negatively affected the long term. Perhaps it was even a net positive but what a strange story.</p>



<p>As I was reading I used the Kindle&#8217;s great highlights feature to select my favourite quotes:</p>



<blockquote>A few weeks later he called Bob Belleville, one of the hardware designers on the Xerox Star team. “Everything you’ve ever done in your life is shit,” Jobs said, “so why don’t you come work for me?” Belleville did, and so did Larry Tesler.</blockquote>



<blockquote>“The goal was never to beat the competition, or to make a lot of money. It was to do the greatest thing possible, or even a little greater.” (Andy Hertzfeld)</blockquote>



<blockquote>At one point Kare and Atkinson complained that he was making them spend too much time on tiny little tweaks to the title bar when they had bigger things to do. Jobs erupted. “Can you imagine looking at that every day?” he shouted. “It’s not just a little thing, it’s something we have to do right.”</blockquote>



<blockquote>After the confrontation in the conference room, Gates quietly gave Jobs a private demo of what was being planned for Windows. “Steve didn’t know what to say,” Gates recalled. “He could either say, ‘Oh, this is a violation of something,’ but he didn’t. He chose to say, ‘Oh, it’s actually really a piece of shit.’”</blockquote>



<blockquote>When Jobs asked for a number of options to consider, Rand declared that he did not create different options for clients. “I will solve your problem, and you will pay me,” he told Jobs. “You can use what I produce, or not, but I will not do options, and either way you will pay me.”</blockquote>



<blockquote>“So I asked Issey to make me some of his black turtlenecks that I liked, and he made me like a hundred of them.” Jobs noticed my surprise when he told this story, so he gestured to them stacked up in the closet. “That’s what I wear,” he said. “I have enough to last for the rest of my life.”</blockquote>



<blockquote>People don’t know what they want until you show it to them. That’s why I never rely on market research.</blockquote>



<p>After finishing the book I have an even greater respect for Jobs, a deeper sadness that he died young and less faith that a Jobs-less Apple will continue to make things I love to use every day.</p>
