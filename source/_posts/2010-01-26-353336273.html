This is completely insane. As suggested in the comments a much better idea would be to provide no discount at all on unhealthy products and a steeper discount on healthy food for <em>all employees</em>. There&#8217;s nothing to be gained by making unhealthy people pay more for good food, extremely unhealthy food (fast food, etc.) is already much cheaper.</p>
