<p>Finally, <em>finally</em> <a href="http://getcampusnotes.com/?utm_campaign=launch&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=valhallaisland">Campus Notes</a> is out the door. It took one final weekend codeathon and we had to scrap features to do it but the 1.0 is out. The best part is now getting onto the fun new features we had to put on hold until the important stuff was done. Look forward to our public API.</p>
