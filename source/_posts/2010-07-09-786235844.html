<p><a href="http://asolidbase.net/"><img src="/assets/tumblr/tumblr_l58lujka7k1qzwfbio1_500.png"/></a></p><p>This is the redesign I was working towards when I first started <a href="http://asolidbase.net/">A Solid Base</a> at the start of the year. I&#8217;ve been steadily posting and meticulously tagging to a point where I have enough content to add some useful navigation. I particularly like the navigation by colour.</p>



<p>It wasn&#8217;t until I was about 4 hours in that I realised how similar it is to the <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/">Valhalla Island</a> design structurally. I think the 500 pixel wide limit on photo post images in Tumblr somewhat dictates things.</p>



<p>A real domain now too, <a href="http://asolidbase.net/">asolidbase.net</a>!</p>
