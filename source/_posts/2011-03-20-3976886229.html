<blockquote>The real message of new NYTimes digital pricing: &#8220;For the love of Christ, just let us drop some paper on your porch every day.</blockquote><p><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/scottsimpson/status/49205823024541696">Scott Simpson</a> on the New York Times&#8217; <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/18/opinion/l18times.html">new, way-too-complicated pay wall</a>.</p>



<p>For 150 years the NY Times has been selling their content for a price. It&#8217;s always been very simple: buy an issue or a subscription, get the content. The incredibly hard time they&#8217;re having transferring this model to their website makes no sense to me. The distinction between &#8220;traditional&#8221; computers, mobile phones and tablet computers is ridiculous. If the relatively recent introduction of these new mediums teaches media moguls anything it should be that medium is irrelevant.</p>
