<p>Almost every time I use Maps I wish I had a compass but I barely use the iPhone&#8217;s 3G&#8217;s still camera as it is and I&#8217;m not into convincing myself I&#8217;ll use it more often if the quality is better of if I can shoot video too. So I hadn&#8217;t considered upgrading. Until I saw <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gruber/tags/iphone3gscomparison/">some of the speed comparisons</a>. Apps not only load and launch more quickly but it&#8217;s obvious just how much more responsive to interaction the 3G S is. Now I&#8217;m very interested in what my (still totally silent on the 3G S) <a href="http://personal.optus.com.au/web/ocaportal.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=Template_wRHS&amp;FP=/personal/mobile/iphone3G&amp;site=personal">carrier</a> offers existing 3G customers.</p>
