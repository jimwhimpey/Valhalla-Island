title: "Layers"
---

<p>The graphic in my <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/204911046">last post</a> was composed using <a href="http://www.flyingmeat.com/acorn/">Acorn</a>. I always download these alternative graphics applications, spend about five seconds drawing a line or a box, quit and never open them again, hardly a thorough trial. As simple as the result, this was first time practically trialling any of them.</p>



<p>My biggest issue with Fireworks and Illustrator is bloat. I use a tiny subset of Fireworks&#8217; features. Which would be fine if everything I don&#8217;t use wasn&#8217;t in the way, cluttering the UI, making the entire application slow and prone to crashing while bugs remain in the subset I <em>do</em> use.</p>



<p>Acorn solves that issue, it launches in a second with a well-thought out, organised UI offering only the features you need.</p>



<p>Yet, like other hopeful Creative Suite challengers, it persists with the confusing, unintuitive and plain frustrating layers metaphor. Far and away the best thing about Fireworks and Illustrator is that they treat elements as <em>individual objects</em>, use layers if you want but they&#8217;re purely an organisational tool.</p>



<p>Photoshop has by far the most frustrating implementation of layers, you can&#8217;t even select a box without consulting the layers palette. Acorn isn&#8217;t that bad but in my small trial I was frustrated twice. First by the inability to shift select elements between layers and then by having the opacity meter affect every object on the layer of my selected object rather than simply my selected object.</p>



<p>I want to draw elements, resize them, align them and set type â€” I don&#8217;t want to administrate layers. While apps like Acorn hold on to the archaic and unintuitive layers paradigm they&#8217;ll never be a viable option for me.</p>
