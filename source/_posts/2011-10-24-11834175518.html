I believe that and whole-heartedly support the Occupy Wall Street protests. But this comparison is dumb.</p>



<p>The annual salary of a US congressperson is between <a href="http://usgovinfo.about.com/od/uscongress/a/congresspay.htm">$175 and $193k</a>, <em>of course</em> they&#8217;re more likely to be millionaires. Making this comparison is like pointing out that there&#8217;s way more relative millionaire <em>dentists</em> than there are in the general population.</p>
