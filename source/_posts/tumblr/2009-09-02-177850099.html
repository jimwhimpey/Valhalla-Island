title: "Subtle Differences"
---

<p>From the day I signed up for Twitter almost three years ago I used <a href="http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific">Twitterrific</a>. A few months ago when <a href="http://www.atebits.com/tweetie-mac/">Tweetie</a> was released I made the switch. It was a small learning curve but up until I recently switched back to Twitterrific, I&#8217;d totally forgotten about the differences. The most notable one and reason I switched to Tweetie in the first place is the behaviour that immediately follows an update.</p>



<p>Twitterrific clears the input field and not until the next timeline refresh is your tweet displayed. Tweetie posts it instantly to your timeline. One makes you question whether your tweet has been posted, the other provides instant satisfaction.</p>
