<p>I understand the desire to shower in the morning. It&#8217;s a nice, fresh way to wake yourself and start the day. I don&#8217;t understand <em>only</em> showering in the morning.</p>



<p>The day is when you get dirty. Bringing that dirt to bed then washing it off in the morning, just in time to get dirty again doesn&#8217;t make sense. The bed is clean, if you want to be clean the next day showering only at night is works because you don&#8217;t get dirty while you sleep.</p>



<p>If you hold water preservation goals and limit yourself to a single shower per day, the evening option has to be the way to go. Sleep clean, start the day clean.</p>
