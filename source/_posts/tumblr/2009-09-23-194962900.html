<blockquote>

  <p>Can I just stop here, and can we be honest with each other? Does this kind of acting resonate with anybody? [&#8230;] Are there people who can relate to — let alone enjoy — this video? And has there ever been a more vibrant and tangible demonstration of the difference between Apple and Microsoft?</p>

<p>At first I thought I&#8217;d need to be careful to avoid overstating my case as what&#8217;s wrong with this video (and on a higher level, the entire concept) should be crystal clear to <em>everyone</em>. But obviously it&#8217;s not, this and the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/LaunchParties#play/uploads">other 100+ supporting videos</a> didn&#8217;t make themselves. <em>Real people</em> had to pitch, write, storyboard, film, direct, edit, publish and <em>sign off on</em> this series. Having read many <a href="http://moishelettvin.blogspot.com/2006/11/windows-shutdown-crapfest.html">stories about the bureaucracy</a> involved in writing software for Microsoft surely that same bureaucracy should stop videos like this ever reaching the public eye.</p>



<p>The concept is insane. I <em>love</em> OS X and there is <em>no way</em> I would ever host a &#8220;launch party&#8221; for a new release, no matter what the incentive. Who the fuck are they targetting with this campaign? Who in their right mind invites friends into their homes to promote a product they have absolutely no stake in? The people in these commercials don&#8217;t exist, the way they&#8217;re acting and talking is down right <em>creepy</em>.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s another strange, completely unrealistic <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=GB&amp;hl=en-GB&amp;v=3oGFogwcx-E">marketing video for Microsoft Songsmith</a>.</p>



<p>What is <em>wrong</em> with Microsoft? As much as you might like Windows, is software made by the same people who invest resources into embarrassingly out-of-touch marketing campaigns like these something anyone can get behind? Like finding out your favourite football player is into dog fighting, they&#8217;re unrelated but you can&#8217;t ignore it.</p>
