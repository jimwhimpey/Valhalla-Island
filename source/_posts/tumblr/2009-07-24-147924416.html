title: "Harry Potter Movies"
---

<p>I remember not enjoying the Harry Potter movies I had seen but after getting my movies up to date with the books I&#8217;ve read over the past few days I realised what&#8217;s missing.</p>



<p>Each Harry Potter book has a primary plot, whatever&#8217;s in the title, The Prisoner of Azkaban, The Goblet of Fire, etc. Problem is, the main story isn&#8217;t all that interesting. What is interesting is the day to day life of witches and wizards. I care little about fighting dementors but I&#8217;m intrigued by the invisibility cloak. The constrained format of a feature film means less time on the superfluous albeit interesting details.</p>
