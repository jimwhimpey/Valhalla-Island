<p>Every month or two I&#8217;m reminded about <a href="http://www.quickflix.com.au/">Quickflix</a>, Australia&#8217;s answer to <a href="http://www.netflix.com/">Netflix</a>, and I go through this same process in my head:</p>



<ol><li>It&#8217;d be cool to watch more movies, maybe I should get a Quickflix membership.</li>

<li>Do I really need to watch more movies? I&#8217;m already so busy and there&#8217;s so much other, more productive things I should and want to be doing.</li>

<li>Stop kidding yourself, just relax and watch a fucking movie. Better to relax properly than spend hours getting nothing done in front of the computer. Then when you <em>are</em> on the computer, it&#8217;ll be productive time.</li>

<li>You&#8217;re right but even though I have a nice big TV, my computer chair is more comfortable than my crappy couch anyway, why not just download movies and watch them on the computer?</li>

<li>Then I forget about Quickflix.</li>

</ol>
