<p>The single funniest segment in <a href="http://maniacalragepodcast.com/">Maniacal Rage Podcast</a> history. Make sure you listen through the music and all the way to the end. Two years and many listens later it still makes me laugh a lot. Relistening to these old clips makes me really miss the audio only days of Maniacal Rage podcast.</p>
