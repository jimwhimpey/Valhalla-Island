<p>My workplace has a liberal dress policy, you can just as easily get away with a nice shirt, pant and tie as you can shorts and a hoodie. What I&#8217;ve worn every day since starting there lands right between the two. A pair of slacks with a button down collared shirt which is sometimes tucked in, sometimes not depending on the combo and a hard-soled shoe.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t mind this outfit, it&#8217;s basically comfortable and practical. But I don&#8217;t <em>love</em> it, outside of work I&#8217;m reluctant to wear long pants at all and I hate jeans. I ride to work so the hard shoe isn&#8217;t ideal, I need to roll up my pant cuffs and as we get towards the end of the year it&#8217;s only getting hotter.</p>



<p>Theoretically I prefer my current dress, if not something nicer, I like the idea of looking sharp. Practically, I&#8217;d be much more comfortable in shorts during the day and my commute would be more enjoyable but I&#8217;d look less professional. I&#8217;m leaning towards shorts.</p>
