title: Adjective Noun Pairs
---

<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about adjective noun pairs that are used almost exclusively together. It&#8217;s hard to find a noun that&#8217;s <em>only</em> used when it&#8217;s being described by one particular adjective but it&#8217;s easier to find an adjective that&#8217;s almost only used to describe one noun. Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve got so far:</p>



<ul><li>Avid Photographer</li>

<li>Moot Point</li>

<li>Cold-blooded Killer</li>

<li>Robust API</li>

<li>Gaping Void</li>

<li>Canonical Example</li>

</ul>
