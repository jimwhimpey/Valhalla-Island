title: "Escalators"
---

<p>The way people behave on escalators fascinates me. When faced with an escalator with minimal obstacles you have two options:</p>



<ol><li>Keep walking. Get double the speed for the equivalent effort.</li>

<li>Stop walking. Go the same speed, or slower for zero effort.</li>

</ol><p>It blows me away to see people walking briskly through a shopping centre only to stop dead on an empty escalator. To choose doing nothing and maintaining speed over making <em>no extra effort</em> and doubling your progress says something greater about a person I think.</p>
