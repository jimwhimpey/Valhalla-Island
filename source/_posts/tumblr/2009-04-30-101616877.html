  <p>Everyone has a particular way that they use Office, and they are literally trying to accommodate every possible layout or customization that anyone has ever wanted in the history of time.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>It&#8217;s a complete shitstorm of icons, labels, toolbars, panels, tabs, menus and sections. 95% of people use 5% of Office&#8217;s features but instead of keeping the stuff you don&#8217;t use out of the way, it&#8217;s in your way and degrades the whole experience.</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Nothing to get too excited about—especially since it&#8217;ll be a while before we all head to Office 2010—but it looks like a decent start.</p>
