<p>In 2007 I travelled through the US and was taken aback by the guilty-until-proven-innocent-style security measures. Three years and some failed terrorist plots later it&#8217;s reached soaring new heights of human-rights-defying invasiveness.</p>



<p>The latest &#8220;security upgrade&#8221; which provides a choice between a radiation emitting, naked body imaging backscatter machine or a full body pat down is bereft of respect for people&#8217;s privacy and dignity. Incredibly the TSA even requires <em>US citizens</em> to <a href="http://noblasters.com/post/1650102322/my-tsa-encounter">take part in these procedures upon <em>entering</em> the USA</a>.</p>



<p>If I was a US citizen I&#8217;d be ashamed of my country. As long as this is the requirement for travelling to or within the US I won&#8217;t be back there.</p>
