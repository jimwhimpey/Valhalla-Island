<p>This is what happens every time I see <a href="http://fieldnotesbrand.com/">Field Notes</a>:</p>



<ol><li>I think they look fantastic.</li>

<li>I really want them.</li>

<li>I plan to order a pack as soon as I get home.</li>

<li>I remind myself that I very rarely use paper at all and have no desire to start so a $10 pack of designer notebooks is of no use to me, no matter how good they look.</li>

<li>I forget about Field Notes.</li>

</ol>
