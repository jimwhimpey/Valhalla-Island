title: "The Dumbest Idea in the World"

<p><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/stevedenning/2011/11/28/maximizing-shareholder-value-the-dumbest-idea-in-the-world/">Maximising shareholder value</a> that is. Roger Martin in his book Fixing the Game:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Imagine an NFL coach holding a press conference on Wednesday to announce that he predicts a win by 9 points on Sunday, and that bettors should recognize that the current spread of 6 points is too low. Or picture the team’s quarterback standing up in the postgame press conference and apologizing for having only won by 3 points when the final betting spread was 9 points in his team’s favor. While it’s laughable to imagine coaches or quarterbacks doing so, CEOs are expected to do both of these things.</p>

  

  <p>[&#8230;]</p>

  

  <p>If this were the situation in the NFL, then everyone would realize that the “real game” of football had become utterly corrupted by the “expectations game” of gambling.</p>

<p>This is why I&#8217;d be bothered about Facebook&#8217;s IPO if I had an account there, the focus will be moved from what&#8217;s best for you as a customer to what&#8217;s best for the shareholder. I don&#8217;t even know why Facebook would want to do it, they had $3.5 billion of revenue last year, they don&#8217;t need the money and they&#8217;d lose control.</p>
