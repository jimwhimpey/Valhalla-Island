<p><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/"><img src="/assets/tumblr/oaQecruTZm9z84d27NxOB2G7o1_500.png"/></a></p><p>Tomorrow will mark my 5th day at my first full time job. It&#8217;s a web developer position at <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/">ABC News Online</a>. That is the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, a government funded, non-commercial national broadcaster. They have two national TV channels, heaps of local radio stations around the country, produce many of their own news and current affairs programs and run an online news department. They have a reputation for quality and substance that other free-to-air broadcasters in Australia lack.</p>



<p>The news site serves around 600,000 visits per day depending on big news stories and makes up the vast majority of the ABC&#8217;s website traffic. We have a massive amount of constantly fresh and deep archives of content and statistics to work with, it&#8217;s my job to make it accessible and usable on the web.</p>



<p>The setup of the site borders between hacked together and ingenious. I&#8217;m learning a lot about scaling, caching and legacy systems.</p>



<p>Before starting at the ABC I saw corporate web development as an isolated bubble void of innovation, up to date practices, standards support or regard for the web in the real world. My colleagues are better than any freelance or small team developer I&#8217;ve come across. They&#8217;re knowledge is up to the minute, as is their skill and I was surprised to find a high level of flexibility, innovation, openness to ideas and an absence of bureaucracy.</p>



<p>Currently I use a temporary PC at the office which is really slowing me down. I&#8217;ve requested a Mac, another team uses them in Sydney but my hopes aren&#8217;t high. If I don&#8217;t get one ABC issued I&#8217;ll upgrade my PowerBook to a MacBook and use that at work. I can work five times as fast and have more fun doing it in OS X, it&#8217;s worth it when I&#8217;m spending eight hours a day there.</p>



<p>The other issue is my home&#8217;s distance from work. It&#8217;s not <em>huge</em> but it requires a change of trains in the city and that plus walking to the station at both ends adds up to about <strong>four hours a day</strong> travelling on top of the eight hours I&#8217;m already working. It&#8217;s too much. Factor in eating and sleeping and I&#8217;m left with only a couple of hours spare each day.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve wanted to get out of home for a long time so as soon as a few pay cheques come in Kristin and I are going to find a place within walking or cycling distance of the city and our workplaces. My commute time will be cut to 15 enjoyable minutes each way and I&#8217;ll save three and a half hours per day. I&#8217;m looking forward to it but until then I&#8217;ll tough it out.</p>
