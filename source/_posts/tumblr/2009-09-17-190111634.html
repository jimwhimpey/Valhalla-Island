<p>Part of my rehabilitation included a session on nutrition. We were taught about the difference between white and brown bread â€” processed and whole foods. I knew processed foods were bad but I never understood why or what processing even meant. The dietician described it beautifully: processed food is pre-chewed food.  A machine takes your natural, whole ingredients, chews them up, all the while removing nutrients, energy and other good stuff before pumping them with preservatives and spitting it out, ready for you to eat, just like it was at the start of the process, only no where near as good for you.</p>
