title: "Ideal Online Ordering"
---

<p>I order a lot of things online. Even a bad online ordering experience usually beats out the actually going to a store equivalent. I feel like I&#8217;ve run the entire gamut of ordering systems and there&#8217;s a sweet spot. Apple&#8217;s online store nails it. This is what they do that makes it so good:</p>



<ul><li>A store for each country or area with prices in the local currency and accurate delivery estimates. Everything in the store is available to you. For an Australian, this is where Amazon falls down.</li>

<li>Free shipping on everything, no exceptions.</li>

<li>The fastest shipping available, no exceptions. You&#8217;re not forced to choose between a multitude of slightly different options, they don&#8217;t use shipping to cut costs, you simply get the fastest. I&#8217;ve had multiple situations where I&#8217;ve ordered something from the Apple online store at 3pm one day and had it arrive before 9am the next.</li>

<li>Two emails: the first one sent out immediately to confirm your order the next usually a few hours later confirming it&#8217;s been sent out that includes a link to the package tracking facility. I&#8217;ve had packages arrive from Ebay extremely quickly but without even a confirmation that they received my payment. Equally bad is an email every time your order is glanced at sideways.</li>

</ul>
