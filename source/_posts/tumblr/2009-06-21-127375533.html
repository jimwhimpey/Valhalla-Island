Up until last week I&#8217;d never had any exposure to NASCAR and I thought that the driving round in circles and making left turns thing was an exaggerated joke. Turns out, <a href="http://www.nascar.com/races/tracks/">it&#8217;s not</a>, they actually drive hundreds of laps around big ovals in different cities. As dumb as it seems I have to say that I respect their ability to do one thing and do it extremely well.</p>
