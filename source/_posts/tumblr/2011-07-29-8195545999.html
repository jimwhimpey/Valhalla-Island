<p>The trailer for what looks like a fascinating movie. The concept:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>In the late 21st century, time has replaced money as the unit of currency. At 25 years old, aging stops and each person is given one more year to live. Unless you replenish your clock, you die.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>You spend time earning more time, buying goods and services costs time. It would certainly change your priorities.</p>
