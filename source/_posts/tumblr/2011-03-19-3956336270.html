title: "And Another Thing"

<p>I understand that they&#8217;re different departments and it really makes no sense to halt one part of your &#8220;business&#8221; while another struggles when your goal obviously isn&#8217;t to make money.</p>



<p><em>But</em>, that doesn&#8217;t stop things like the new <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/explore">explore page</a>, <a href="http://staff.tumblr.com/post/3767474880/sxsw">exursions to SXSW</a> and <a href="http://staff.tumblr.com/post/3791418445/join-the-tumblr-community-for-a-party-and-live">some hipster poetry thing</a> pissing me off when core shit like <em>serving content reliably</em> isn&#8217;t happening.</p>
