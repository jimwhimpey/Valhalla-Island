title: "Helmets"
---

<p>This is an argument that&#8217;s come up over and over again lately as more Australian cities implement public bike hire programs which are failing.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll state my position again: helmets <strong>should not</strong> be compulsory for adults. The kind of riding a casual cyclist commuting on a 30kg public bike does is <em>extremely low risk</em>. It&#8217;s clear helmets are a barrier to more people cycling while similar programs in helmet-less nations have flourished. The more people cycling, the more demand for cycling infrastructure, the more aware and accepting motorists will be of cyclists and the safer cycling becomes for everyone. It&#8217;s simple.</p>



<p>Because I am a glutton for punishment, I read the comments on <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/sport/cycling/blogs/cycling-tips/change-of-tune-20110817-1iwx4.html">articles like this one</a> from Wade Wallace and there are two arguments that infuriate me the most.</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Yes, the bicycles are the sturdy sit-up and beg type, but they are still vulnerable to what you call the biggest threat: traffic. Well, that&#8217;s why I always put my helmet on.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Are we so accustomed to the nanny state that someone would be against a law being repealed because they currently adhere to the law as it makes them feel personally safer? <em>Repealing the law doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;re not allowed to wear a helmet if you want to</em>! Many people would still wear helmets, I would still wear a helmet 99% of the time. Ahh!</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Cycle deaths in Australia are numbered each year in the 100s, in the U.K. they number in the 1000s (and are apparently in the increase). Cycle helmets save lives (lots and lots of them) - simple as that.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>That is not the argument. <em>No one</em> is arguing that you&#8217;re less likely to die in a crash if you&#8217;re not wearing a helmet. The argument is that the net safety gain of having many more bikes and less cars on the road, net general health gains of having more people more active and net environmental and societal gains from quiet, safer, zero emission transportation <em>far</em> outweighs the benefit of having a helmet on by law in bike accident situations which, even if the law was repealed, people would be wearing helmets in <em>anyway</em>.</p>
