<p><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/sharks_vs_cats">Sharks vs. Cats</a></p><p>When I first saw the cool avatar modification in my dashboard I couldn&#8217;t wait put my weight behind sharks or cats. But it&#8217;s not that simple, I can&#8217;t decide. I&#8217;m definitely not a cat person, they&#8217;re rude, selfish and exploit their owners. Sharks on the other hand make swimming in the ocean life threatening and eat <a href="http://peetiro.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/baby-seal1.jpg">seals</a>, the dogs of the ocean. Both options are equally unappealing, I can&#8217;t choose.</p>
