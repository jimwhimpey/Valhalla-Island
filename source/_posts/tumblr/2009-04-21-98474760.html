title: The Membership Model
---

<p>When my local pool changed ownership they ditched time based memberships for entry based. Previously you could buy one, three, six or twelve month membership that allowed you unlimited entry to the pool. The new system sells 20 and 40 entry passes and no other kind of membership. (Drop in entries remain in both systems).</p>



<p>The membership model made you feel like part of something, the pool was yours, literally at your unlimited disposal. It encouraged regular sessions at the pool as you wanted to get your money&#8217;s worth each month. Pay for a month&#8217;s membership, only visit the pool twice and you&#8217;ve wasted your money.</p>



<p>The entry model makes you feel as good as the number of entries left on your card. Each visit brings you closer to the day you have to pay again. It discourages visits while you question whether it&#8217;s really worth using your quota on a day you don&#8217;t feel 100% or the weather is a little cooler.</p>



<p>At a place like a pool where the water has to be kept clean, the front desk attended, the grounds tidy and the lifeguards on duty whether there&#8217;s people swimming or not, the entry model doesn&#8217;t make sense for the business or swimmers.</p>
