<img src="/assets/tumblr/tumblr_l46lvzC6TG1qzwfbio1_500.jpg"/><br/><p>I was excited about this gorgeous Lost map printed on canvas. Then I saw <a href="http://www.imagekind.com/Geography-of-LOST-Retrospective_art?IMID=742826ff-34cc-47ff-83ae-8969da9dc12d">the full print</a> with its terrible, cramped, centre aligned system font typography in the corner. The entire bottom section is unnecessary. Part of the print&#8217;s original appeal was the lack of branding but the useless eyesore of a fake brand totally ruins the whole thing.</p>
