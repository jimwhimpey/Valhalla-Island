<p><ol><li>Take a lot of photos.</li>

<li>Import everything into <a href="http://www.apple.com/aperture/">Aperture</a>.</li>

<li>Browse all the photos, 5 star the ones I like, delete the clearly terrible.</li>

<li>Filter by 5 stars, choose the best of similar photos and zero star the others. Zero star anything that, on second thought, isn&#8217;t great.</li>

<li>With the remaining 5 stared photos: crop if required, auto colour levels, adjust exposure, contrast, saturation and recovery if necessary.</li>

<li>Fill out title and caption metadata on remaining photos.</li>

<li>Upload to Flickr as a set using <a href="http://connectedflow.com/flickrexport/aperture/">Flickr Uploader for Aperture</a> (Aperture 3&#8217;s built-in Flickr Uploader sucks).</li>
