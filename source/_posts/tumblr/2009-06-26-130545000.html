title: "Forgetting Apple is supposed to suck, one iPhone at a time"
---

<p><a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001280.html">This post about the iPhone</a> from long time Windows developer and lover Jeff Atwood could not be more uncomfortable. Like an 8-year-old boy talking about the girl he has a crush on, he&#8217;s falling over himself trying to say good things about the iPhone without looking like he&#8217;s totally gay for Apple.</p>



<p>Jeff admits he hasn&#8217;t owned an Apple product for 25 years and that lack of experience with Macs is obvious:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>There&#8217;s always been a weird tension in Apple&#8217;s computer designs, because they attempt to control every nuance of the entire experience from end to end. For the best Apple™ experience, you run custom Apple™ applications on artfully designed Apple™ hardware dongles.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Apple&#8217;s hardware and software work great together with Apple&#8217;s peripherals, as a computer user that <em>reduces</em> the tension for me significantly.</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>All those things that bugged me about Apple&#8217;s computers are utter non-issues in the phone market. Proprietary handset? So is every other handset. Locked in to a single vendor? Everyone signs a multi-year contract. One company controlling your entire experience? That&#8217;s how it&#8217;s always been done.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Oh, so that weird tension Apple™ creates by only offering the best Apple™ experience with Apple™ hardware, Apple™ software and Apple™ peripherals doesn&#8217;t bother you at all in a market where <em>actually</em> being locked in by way of contract is the status quo. The same way I&#8217;m cool with treating women like dirt when I&#8217;m hanging out with my Saudi Arabian friends.</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Apple has never been particularly great at supporting software developers [&#8230;]</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Except when it comes to providing a full suite of developer tools with the operating system and offering developer connection subscriptions both completely free rather than <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-au/subscriptions/subscriptionschart.aspx">charging the 1000s of dollars Microsoft does</a>, yeah they&#8217;re not great at supporting developers.</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>If this has all come across as too rah-rah, too uncritical a view of the iPhone, I apologize. There are certainly things to be critical about, such as the App Store&#8217;s weird enforcement policies, the lack of support for emulators, or Flash, or anything else that might somehow undermine the platform as decided in some paranoid, secretive Apple back room. Not that we&#8217;d ever hear about it.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>God <em>forbid</em> you give an uncritical review of something you obviously love. Quick, ridicule Apple&#8217;s secretiveness, that&#8217;ll do. Lack of support for Flash or emulators couldn&#8217;t possibly be a trade-off to improve phone experience you&#8217;re currently lauding as a whole.</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>I didn&#8217;t write this to kiss Apple&#8217;s ass.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>You <em>didn&#8217;t</em>?! And here I was about to call you an Apple fanboi because there&#8217;s no way a phone could actually be <em>that good</em>. Up until now I thought your review must be based on unwavering loyalty to the Apple brand, not the phone&#8217;s merits.</p>



<p>This is a long standing dilemma for Mac users and lovers trying to communicate the virtues of the platform with Windows users. We use Macs because it&#8217;s a better, friction less experience, not because we&#8217;re married to Apple. I can only assume that it&#8217;s because they&#8217;re so tragically hardened by their long-standing, endless, multiple computer battle trying to force Windows to do what they want that they simply cannot believe or don&#8217;t want to believe (they&#8217;ve already invested SO. MUCH. TIME. ALREADY) that a computer exists without those problems that&#8217;s a joy to use.</p>



<p>On a greater scale than the iPod, the iPhone is going lure in a huge amount of non-Mac users. There&#8217;s little barrier to finding out what a joyful, easy experience it can be when a company that cares about user experience and good design creates a product, hardware, software, peripherals and from the ground up to work together. A lot of people, even curmudgeonly old Windows developers, will hang up their hang ups about being &#8220;forced&#8221; to buy a great computer to run great software and will enjoy the computer again just as they enjoy their new phones.</p>
