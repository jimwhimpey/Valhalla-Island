<p>Car commercials dominate almost the only kind of television I watch, sport. With no exceptions, every car advertised mentions its impressively powerful engine, many running entire campaigns around performance.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t understand it. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_(automobile)">Smart Car</a> with its 3 cylinder, 1 litre engine has a top speed of 130&#160;km/h, 20km/h <em>beyond</em> the highest legal speed limit of any road in Australia. How is any power beyond that, <em>always</em> at the expense of fuel economy, practical let alone a selling point?</p>



<p>Why are 6 cylinder cars even something you can buy? Is there anything else for sale in the world so needlessly excessive? Every equivalent I can imagine is totally insane. Like a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/traveller2020/3935737528/">60 metre wide screen</a> for your lounge room.</p>
