title: "Leave"
---

<p>Instead of public holidays I get an extra two weeks leave a year which accrues quickly. In the last two years I&#8217;ve taken just under four weeks of leave and three of those I had to take for rehabilitation following my bike accident. That means one week of recreational leave in two years, not much.</p>



<p>Contrary to what that might seems I&#8217;m not at all a workaholic and I think that&#8217;s the reason I feel so little compulsion to take leave.</p>



<p>I enjoy my job and while at work, I work hard but when my eight hours are up I go home and lead a rich life outside in my &#8220;down&#8221; time. While others either hate their jobs or work themselves into the ground to the point of desperately needing leave to rejuvenate and attend to their recreational lives, I maintain the balance.</p>
