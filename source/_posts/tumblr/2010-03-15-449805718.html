title: "Carfree Cities"
---

<p>On the eve of the opening of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clem_Jones_Tunnel">CLEM7</a>, a $3.2 billion automobile underground tunnel made to ease Brisbane&#8217;s heavy traffic congestion, I finished reading <a href="http://www.carfree.com/">Carfree Cities</a>.</p>



<p>In it J.H. Crawford advocates the benefits of carfree cities <em>and</em> provides a significantly detailed reference design for how one could build a carfree city or convert an existing city to the carfree design. It&#8217;s a deeply thought-out, flexible concept grounded in hard geometry and proven technology, not pie in the sky dreaming.</p>



<p>The motivation for Crawford&#8217;s proposition is not in environmentalism (although it is a pleasant side effect) but in quality of life. The book is focused on visually pleasing surroundings, safe environments, low noise, vibrant atmosphere, fast convenient transport, clean air and a strong communities. This is the brilliance of Carfree Cities. While anyone will argue that something as personally distant as pollution is a small price to pay for the (perceived) convenience of cars, it&#8217;s hard to argue against your own quality of life.</p>



<p>Cars certainly have a place in the world, there is little other feasible option for long distance travel to remote areas. But in cities they are nothing short of destructive.</p>



<p>Cars are isolating. You&#8217;re literally moving around the world in a bubble. It&#8217;s often completely impossible to interact with a good friend while travelling in a car, even if you have both seen each other and are travelling slowly. Chance encounters are rare in a car centric city.</p>



<p>They kill street life. Wide, loud, smelly, dangerous streets are skirted by car parking which only then buildings sit behind. Many city buildings are primarily accessible only through an attached parking garage. The street is only a means to get from car to building with no life of its own.</p>



<p>Think of the vibrant street life in areas of a city where cars are excluded. Brisbane&#8217;s South Bank or any pedestrian mall or square in most of the world&#8217;s capitals cities are good examples. People flock to these areas, the atmosphere is lively and inviting. There&#8217;s little reason entire cities shouldn&#8217;t share the same ambiance.</p>



<p>Cars are just plain dangerous. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_motor_vehicle_deaths_in_U.S._by_year">Tens of thousands of people</a> die at the hands of the automobile every year. If the same number of people were killed by anything else it&#8217;d be considered an epidemic.</p>



<p>Beyond their community and <em>person</em> killing qualities, cars are unsustainable, grossly inefficient, expensive and with the time spent in traffic jams, living further from amenities and the search for car parking, offer no added convenience.</p>



<p>For over a year I&#8217;ve been car-free in a car centric city for health, financial and environmental reasons. It works for me but besides the occasional frustration with poor public transport or inadequate bicycle facilities I had spent little time thinking about the widespread benefits that a carfree city could provide.</p>



<p>My eyes have been been opened and I now find myself resenting the car, the negative trends it fosters and the relentless support of it by legislators. If a city was created based on any permutation of the reference design in Carfree Cities I would do everything I could to move my life there.</p>
