title: Wasting My Best Drinking Years
---

<p>A few of my friends are the drink-at-every-opportunity, go-out-four-nights-a-week, spend-all-your-disposable-income-on-alcohol-and-related-activities type. I used to be the same but since taking up triathlon five months ago I&#8217;ve cut back to almost nothing. I still hang out with these friends and have a great time with them but when I, again, told a friend I wouldn&#8217;t be drinking tonight he said:</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re wasting your best drinking years!&#8221;</p>



<p>I see it in a totally different light. Some training is spent with guys and girls 40-years plus whose bodies struggle to recover from chronic injuries, if they recover at all. Niggling injuries last forever. They react badly to racing and they generally just <em>hurt</em>. It&#8217;s not the case for me, I&#8217;m young, limbre and recover strongly after racing. I&#8217;m making the best use of my body while it&#8217;s still young enough to perform and recover well.</p>
