title: The Apple Tablet?
---

<p>The massive majority of things Apple make have appeal that branches across all kinds of people and use. Advertising agencies, software developers and Mums use iMacs. Business people, tradesmen and high school kids use iPhones. Same goes for MacBooks, Apple TVs, iPods, Airports, Mac Minis, et cetera, et cetera.</p>



<p>A tablet computer has limited appeal. Who, apart from illustrators, illustrators who use a computer, is a tablet useful to?</p>



<p>Apple isn&#8217;t in the business of making products useful only to one specific niche. People in specific niches do use Apple computers but it&#8217;s because they&#8217;re flexible, not because they were made for them.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t expect Apple to make a tablet computer the same way I don&#8217;t expect them to make a point of sale system, air traffic control panel or poker machine.</p>
