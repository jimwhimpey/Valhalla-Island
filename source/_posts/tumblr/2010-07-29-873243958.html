title: "iMac or Mac Pro?"

<blockquote><p>Today’s overdue Mac Pro update is a welcome change, but for a computer that’s so expensive, why not just get an iMac?</p></blockquote>



<p>This is exactly the question I faced when upgrading to my current computer, a low specced 27&#8221; iMac. Three things weighed most heavily into my decision:</p>



<ul><li>A lowest end Mac Pro plus a cinema display is <em>way more</em> expensive than a lowest end iMac. The higher the specs on each model the lower the margin but I have no need for extreme performance.</li>

<li>Six months ago you couldn&#8217;t buy a 27&#8221; LED display outside of an iMac.</li>

<li>Unlike previous generation iMacs and thanks to the wonders of DisplayPort I can use use the iMac&#8217;s display as an external display for a Mac Pro in the future.</li>

</ul><p>So come 6 or 12 months when my low specced iMac starts to feel unbearably slow I&#8217;ll buy a Mac Pro and reap the benefits Marco lists while keeping the most valuable part of the iMac. There&#8217;ll be a computer sitting on the back of the iMac not doing anything but that&#8217;s a small write off.</p>
