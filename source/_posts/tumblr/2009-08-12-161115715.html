<img src="/assets/tumblr/bhKTvCKNAr076i2jhoBU4FyFo1_500.png"/><br/><p>I bought my 15&#8221; Macbook Pro only a week or two before <a href="http://www.marco.org/160551989">Marco</a>. Even if this option was available at the time I think I still would have went glossy but I&#8217;ve since been annoyed by the glossy screen at work so I <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/154742729">tried out</a> a matte screen overlay that I immediately threw away. It cost about the same as what the antiglare option does from the Apple factory, I&#8217;m a little annoyed.</p>
