title: "Buying a Couch"
---

<p>I&#8217;m more than happy with the build and simplicity of Ikea furniture for almost anything but when it comes to a couch, I want something big, robust and super comfortable. Since moving we&#8217;ve now got everything we <em>need</em> and it&#8217;s time to start replacing our crappiest things that have simply done the job with some better things. I&#8217;ve always wanted a corner lounge and our current couches are old hand-me-downs.</p>



<p>We quickly found a great corner lounge for $2300, much too expensive.</p>



<p>A couple of weeks later we resumed the search and found the exact same couch on sale for $1600! A massive $700 off and well within our price range, great! We measured our lounge room and went to the furniture store, measuring tape in hand, ready to lay down the cash.</p>



<p>We found the couch, sat in the couch, loved the couch and then measured the couch. Too big, no way it&#8217;d fit. We browsed the other 80+ couches in the store, none came anywhere near the comfort, practicality (it has a built-in bed) or price of the original brilliant lounge.</p>



<p>We came home and slumped into our ridiculously low, vinyl, old, two seater lounges, dejected.</p>



<p>Then I had a brilliant idea, a complete rearrangement of the lounge room into a layout so crazy it just might work. The more we thought about, the more we measured and mapped out, the more possible and just plain superior to our current setup it looked! Great! We can buy the couch, first thing next weekend!</p>



<p>This afternoon I check the website looking for a phone number so I could ask about getting it up our stairs and into the apartment. <strong>Horror</strong>! The couch is no longer on sale for $1600 but for $2000! Fuck!</p>



<p>I call the store, begging for the sale price of just two days ago, when we were ready to buy. He told me the probably-bullshit story of their suppliers upping the price but agreed to meet me half way, $1800. I reluctantly accepted.</p>
