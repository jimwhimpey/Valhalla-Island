<blockquote>The last days are marked by hallucinations: bears, wolves and aliens prowl the roadside; asphalt cracks rearrange themselves into coded messages. Occasionally, Robic leaps from his bike to square off with shadowy figures that turn out to be mailboxes. In a 2004 race, he turned to see himself pursued by a howling band of black-bearded men on horseback.</blockquote><p>From an NY Times feature on what happens to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/05/sports/playmagazine/05robicpm.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=all">Jure Robic&#8217;s mind</a> during extreme endurance events.</p>



<p>When I was doing a lot of running and swimming, at the end of a long run I would get a mild case of these kind of things. I&#8217;d mistake inanimate things for animals or people: a shrub could be a dog, a tree trunk could be a gardener but I&#8217;d immediately snap out of it. It was that or a state of semi detachment which was really quite a nice feeling, snapping out of that would feel like waking up.</p>



<p>I can&#8217;t imagine what it must feel like going through the sleep deprived hell of something like Le Tour Direct.Robic is a very hard man. Via <a href="http://kottke.org/10/04/insanely-great-at-ultra-endurance-races">Kottke</a>.</p>
