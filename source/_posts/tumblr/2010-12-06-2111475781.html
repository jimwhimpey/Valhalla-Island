<blockquote>I am an Australian citizen and I miss my country a great deal. However, during the last weeks the Australian prime minister, Julia Gillard, and the attorney general, Robert McClelland, have made it clear that not only is my return is impossible but that they are actively working to assist the United States government in its attacks on myself and our people. This brings into question what does it mean to be an Australian citizen - does that mean anything at all?</blockquote><p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/blog/2010/dec/03/julian-assange-wikileaks">Julian Assange answers your questions</a>.

<p>Out of all this Wikileaks stuff this is what concerns me the most. That an Australian citizen who has been convicted of no crime has been so shamelessly hung out to dry by his prime minister.</p>
