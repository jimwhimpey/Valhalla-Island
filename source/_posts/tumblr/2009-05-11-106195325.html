<p><a href="http://achoiceinthematter.tumblr.com/">1001 things I want in a lover</a> is a tumblog that often features on Tumblr&#8217;s <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/popular">popular posts list</a>. Here&#8217;s a few typical post examples:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Someone who has my schedule memorized with the purpose of surprising me.</p>

  

  <p>Someone who thinks everything I do is adorable.</p>

  

  <p>Someone who thinks that Iâ€™m the best thing that ever happened.</p>

  

  <p>Someone who will always have my favorite cereal at their house every time I come over.</p>

  

  <p>Someone who teaches me something new everyday.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>I can&#8217;t stand this bullshit. You don&#8217;t want a lover, you want a butler. No person leading their own life does half this shit. No one is going to spend their life dedicated to indulging your every whim and doting on your every insecurity. And if they did, I guarantee you&#8217;d get bored of it quickly.</p>
