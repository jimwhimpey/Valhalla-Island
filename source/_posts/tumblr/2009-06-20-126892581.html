Almost all my clothes tell me to wash in cold water, spin slowly, don&#8217;t mix colours and never tumble dry. In the case of my running and cycling gear it&#8217;s hand wash and drip dry <em>only</em>. I&#8217;ve ignored all those instructions for years and my clothes aren&#8217;t ruined and their colours have never run.</p>
