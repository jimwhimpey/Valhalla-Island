A brand new pedestrian and cycling bridge opened over the weekend and another motorist bridge is well under construction. Seven of the bridges are within a 1500m river shoreline, then there&#8217;s nothing for five or six kilometres until the university. Even one bridge splitting that gap, connecting Toowong to West End, would be nice.</p>
