It&#8217;s perfectly organised, easy to navigate, functional and most importantly, provides great photos in super high resolutions.</p>



<p>The one thing it&#8217;s missing is price. I understand that prices differ all over the world and Trek have an obligation to send you to their suppliers but even a USD RRP would complete the online window shopping experience.</p>
