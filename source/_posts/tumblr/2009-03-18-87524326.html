<p>Pete and Brian are utterly brilliant. It&#8217;s been a long time since they&#8217;ve released something and this doesn&#8217;t disappoint. Every single one is perfectly acted, beautifully shot and produced. It seems they&#8217;ve uploaded a bunch of their old videos in high quality now too. Some of my old favourites are <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBSi8qC0tFA&amp;fmt=18">Showdown</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DFTmBrMYPw&amp;fmt=18">Knock Knock</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cg_1cjQbtk&amp;fmt=18">Pitch Meeting</a> and the classic <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPo9sCqza98&amp;fmt=18">FCU: Fact Checkers Unit</a> with Bill Murray.</p>
