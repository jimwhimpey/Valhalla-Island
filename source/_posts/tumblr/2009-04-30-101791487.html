<p>There&#8217;s a fantastic example on Tumblr of feature addition that&#8217;s invisible to anyone not using it. End your text, photo, link, audio or video post with a question mark and a new field with a check box appears asking to allow answers.</p>



<p>Sure you have to end in a question mark to know about the feature but unless you&#8217;re ending in a question mark, you have no need for the feature anyway.</p>
