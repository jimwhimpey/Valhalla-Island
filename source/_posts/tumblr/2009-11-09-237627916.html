<p>For as long as the term &#8220;social media&#8221; has been around I haven&#8217;t had a clue what  exactly it <em>means</em>. I can&#8217;t define it, no one I know, even those who use it regularly, can define it. Until now.</p>



<p>Social media is automatically posting a digest of your tweets to your blog.</p>



<p>And automatically sending your blog posts to your Twitter feed.</p>



<p>And automatically posting both to your Facebook page.</p>



<p>While clicking follow, the only manual part of the process.</p>
