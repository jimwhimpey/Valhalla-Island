title: "Birthday Haul"

<p>It was my birthday over the weekend and I was lucky to get some great presents from my loved ones.</p>



<p><strong><a href="http://buy.garmin.com/shop/products/products/edge705/">Garmin Edge 705</a></strong> from <em>Kristin</em>.

Literally the best bike computer available. Speed, cadence, power, heart rate, altitude, maps and GPS. It has a ton of dashboard style display options and is easy to upload and analyse at <a href="http://connect.garmin.com/explore?owner=jimwhimpey">Garmin Connect</a>, a beautifully polished web application.</p>



<p><strong><a href="http://www.apple.com/airportextreme/">Airport Extreme</a></strong> from <em>My Mum</em>.

Completely sick of my ISP provided, flakey piece of shit wireless router it&#8217;s great to finally get something reliable. The N protocol is more than noticeably faster when transferring big files. I&#8217;m yet to put it through its paces streaming HD video to the Xbox.</p>



<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Its-Not-About-Bike-Journey/dp/0399146113">It&#8217;s Not About the Bike</a></strong> from <em>Kristin</em>.

The amazing story of Lance Armstrong. A book I&#8217;ve wanted for a long time. I&#8217;m a quarter of the way in and can barely put it down.</p>



<p><strong><a href="http://www.allenandunwin.com/default.aspx?page=94&amp;book=9781741755596">50 Marathons 50 Days</a></strong> from <em>My Sister</em>.

Just looking at the cover of this book is inspiring. This is the same guy that ran 260 consecutive miles over 76 hours.</p>
