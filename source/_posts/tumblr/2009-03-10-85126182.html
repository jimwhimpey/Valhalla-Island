<blockquote>I seldom use Cover Flow mode in iTunes and never in the Finder, but for web page history, it strikes me as downright useful — perfect for finding a page when you don’t remember the name or URL, but you do remember what it looked like.</blockquote>From John Gruber&#8217;s <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2009/03/safari_4_public_beta">Safari 4 Beta observations</a>. As far as I&#8217;m concerned the Cover Flow view in iTunes and <em>especially</em> in the Finder is a useless gimmick. But after browsing website history with Cover Flow in Safari 4 I&#8217;ve found it remarkably practical and useful, it seems to have found it&#8217;s place.
