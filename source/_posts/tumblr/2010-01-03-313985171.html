title: "The Tablet"
---

<p>Despite analysis finally coming from <a href="http://arstechnica.com/staff/fatbits/2010/01/antacid-tablet.ars">some</a> <a href="http://www.marco.org/">respectable</a> <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2009/12/the_tablet">sources</a> I&#8217;m having trouble getting enthusiastic or even interested in the mythical Apple Tablet.</p>



<p>Even the most extreme and unlikely predictions don&#8217;t appeal to me. Until proved wrong by an actual product I agree with Steve Jobs alleged dismissal of tablet computers: <em>&#8220;What are these things good for besides surfing the Web on the toilet?&#8221;</em></p>
