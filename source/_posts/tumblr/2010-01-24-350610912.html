<p>The way I see it, meat is the epitome of processed foods. Thousands of litres of water, fertiliser and months producing grain and produce that&#8217;s processed into feed for animals. Thousands more of litres of water, tons of grain and produce fed to cattle over their entire lifespan. Years after the <em>process</em> began the meat is processed into little packages ready to be transported to your supermarket.</p>



<p>We can eat what cattle eat, why not cut out the middle <del>man</del> animal?</p>
