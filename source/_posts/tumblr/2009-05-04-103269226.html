<p>Last night we were fortunate to see this beautiful song performed by The Middle East. Unfortunately it was the only song we saw. I&#8217;d never heard of them, the name put me off and the support often sucks. I couldn&#8217;t have been more wrong this time. This is exactly the kind of nuanced, <em>thick</em> music I love. I should&#8217;ve known Okkervil River would choose their support carefully.</p>



<p>Apologies for the audio quality, it&#8217;s <a href="http://rogueamoeba.com/audiohijackpro/">hijacked</a> from their <a href="http://www.myspace.com/visitthemiddleeast">MySpace</a> (the band&#8217;s only website). While I mostly missed them this time I&#8217;ll catch them again when they play in June as part of a big East Coast of Australia tour. See them if you can.</p>
