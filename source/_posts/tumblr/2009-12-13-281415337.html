<p>Initially Stuff You Should Know sounded right up my alley. Unfortunately it is not what I hoped it would be: the concise distillation of interesting information organised into a tight presentation. Instead it&#8217;s two dudes having a long-winded, ragtag chat about the topic. There&#8217;s moments of good stuff but what could be a great 10 minute show is 30 minutes of mostly blather between a pair of bros.</p>
