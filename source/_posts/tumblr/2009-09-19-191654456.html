title: "My Day, Yesterday, One Year Ago"

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jimwhimpey/2966100477/">My Day, Yesterday, One Year Ago</a></p><p>I was reminded lately about Garrett Murray&#8217;s <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/mydayyesterday/pool/">My Day, Yesterday Flickr pool</a> I participated in. It was a fun exercise at the time (I find video and audio editing oddly soothing) but it&#8217;s especially interesting looking back. Just one year later my days are vastly different, I can&#8217;t believe I drove from home to one campus and back before getting the train to another and getting home after dark. More than 3 hours of travel for just 3 hours of class!</p>



<p>I&#8217;m someone who finds it difficult to interrupt what I&#8217;m doing to take photos or record video in day to day life so I have little record (beyond memories) of what life was like at any one time. Dedicating a day every year or so to something like this could really be valuable to someone like me.</p>
