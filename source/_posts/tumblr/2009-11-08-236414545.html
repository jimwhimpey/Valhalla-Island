<p>I love the use of diagrams to present information. For humour, to make a point, factually precise or a general approximation, I love it. <a href="http://thisisindexed.com/">Indexed</a> is one my favourite websites.</p>



<p>So <a href="http://venndiagrams.tumblr.com/">Fuck Yeah Venn Diagrams</a> was an instant follow. But I&#8217;ve quickly been disappointed. There&#8217;s little clever distillation of information into graph form and a lot of forcing anything at all into a couple of circles.</p>
