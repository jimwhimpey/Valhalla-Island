title: "Alternative iPhone Ringtones"
---

<p>I&#8217;m not one to fuck around with ringtones on my phone. I choose the closest sound to a real ringing phone and leave it at that forever. But as more people get iPhones more people are using that same ringtone.</p>



<p>iTunes supports creating and buying ringtones made of songs but that&#8217;s not for me, I don&#8217;t associate songs with a ringing phone and don&#8217;t want to.</p>



<p>Turns out if you have iLife installed on your Mac there&#8217;s a rich vein of relatively unique and very much ringtone-like audio loops right on your computer. Navigate to <code>/Library/Audio/Apple Loops/Apple/iLife Sound Effects/Jingles</code>. In there you&#8217;ll find a bunch of loops which by default will open in Apple Loops Utility but can also be played in Quicktime. You can also quickly listen to a bunch by opening the music and sound effects pane and navigating to that folder in iMovie. My favourites are the broadcast news series, flurry, harbor, heroes and the pastel series.</p>



<p>To get them on your iPhone open them in Quicktime and export them as mp3 or aiff files.  Then I used the very simple and straight-forward <a href="http://www.ambrosiasw.com/utilities/itoner/">iToner</a> to transfer those files to the phone as ringtones. After syncing they&#8217;ll appear in your ringtone selection list on the phone under the custom heading. Unfortunately custom ringtones aren&#8217;t supported for message tones.</p>
