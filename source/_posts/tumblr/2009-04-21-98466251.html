<p>On first use a lot bothers me about Tweetie for Mac. No title in the title bar, awkward looking breadcrumbs, âŒ˜R bound to replies rather than refresh, pointless iPhone style scroll bar, forced combination of both menu bar <em>and</em> dock icons held together with mountains of superfluous animation. It&#8217;s the freak offspring of a Mac and iPhone app.</p>



<p>Yet it somehow comes together to make a pleasant overall package. I&#8217;m switching from <a href="http://thecosmicmachine.com/">EventBox</a> for a few days while I try it out properly.</p>
