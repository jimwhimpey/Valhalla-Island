<p>I&#8217;m now half way through <a href="http://www.bignerdranch.com/book/cocoa%C2%AE_programming_for_mac%C2%AE_os_x_3rd_edition">Cocoa Programming for Mac OS X</a> and I&#8217;m still seriously struggling to get my head around things. So much in Cocoa seems to  happen by magic. Take this paragraph:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>You may now be saying, &#8220;Chapter 3 said that the designated initializer does all the work and calls the superclass&#8217;s designated initializer. It said that all other initializers call the designated initializer. But Person has an init method, which is its designated initializer, and this new initializer doesn&#8217;t call it.&#8221; You are right: initWithCoder: is an exception to initializer rules.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Now I had to re-read this about 5 times before I understood what it was saying but that aside, initWithCoder just happens to be an exception to initializer rules. Aaron Hillegass has pointed it out in this case but it feels like &#8220;this just does that, alright?&#8221; is the only explanation for too many things.</p>



<p>That coupled with the abstraction that happens in Interface Builder which is hidden once you return to Xcode makes it difficult for me to get my head around why things are happening or not happening.</p>



<p>Every new chapter I finish I&#8217;m further convinced I should just stick to web development. Hopefully a moment of clarity will come as I start messing around myself and try a range of learning materials.</p>
