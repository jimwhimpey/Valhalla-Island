<img src="/assets/tumblr/tumblr_l5cbra3ndO1qzwfbio1_500.jpg"/><br/><p>Today I saw the <a href="http://qag.qld.gov.au/exhibitions/current/ron_mueck">Ron Mueck exhibition at the Queensland GoMA</a>. Months after the exhibition opened it was still crowded and rightfully so, the pieces are surreal.</p>



<p>It didn&#8217;t even occur to me to take a camera but it seemed the huge majority of patrons were taking photos. Flash photography wasn&#8217;t allowed but many were using flashes anyway (I think most people have no idea  how to turn their flash off nor want to know how). People were moving to a piece, taking a number of photos from different angles, moving to the next and shooting again. There were more camera phones than point and shoots and there were no SLRs.</p>



<p>There are <a href="http://www.google.com.au/images?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=ron%20mueck&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;redir_esc=&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;hl=en&amp;tab=wi">many photos of Ron Mueck&#8217;s work online</a>.</p>



<p>I genuinely want to know what&#8217;s going through people&#8217;s minds when each individual from a group of three is documenting the exhibit with their own terrible phone camera. For what reason are they doing it? To go back and reminisce about that time they went to the art gallery and took photographs? To prove to others that they went? To enjoy the art all over again to make up for what they missed while they were <em>actually there</em>?</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t get it.</p>
