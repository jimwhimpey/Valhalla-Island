<p>My new favourite blog. There&#8217;s no where near the cycling culture of New York City in Australia but nonetheless I love the relentless berating of impractical bike trends. It&#8217;s a funny and refreshing take on a culture that&#8217;s rife with dick heads on every part of the spectrum.</p>
