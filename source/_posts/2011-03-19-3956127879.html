  <p>But here’s the thing, folks: I’ve been complaining for years that Tumblr is free. I don’t want it to be free. I want to pay for it. Tumblr is one of the few services on earth that refuses to take my money.</p>

<p>I feel exactly the same way. Money in exchange for reliability is a much better deal than free with downtime. I truly don&#8217;t understand the desire to give something away for free at any cost and when it&#8217;s at the cost of <em>actually providing</em> the thing you want to provide for free the whole situation is absurd.</p>



<p>This reminds me of <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/292829693">something I wrote</a> a year ago about This American Life begging the listeners of their free podcast to donate money to offset the huge cost of providing the podcast for free. It don&#8217;t make no damn sense.</p>
