<a href="http://virb.com/">New Virb</a><br/><p>Remember the hype around Virb before it even launched the first time? Remember the hype around Virb as a MySpace and Facebook <em>killer</em> when it actually did launch? Yeah, well it failed and completely shut down. Now it&#8217;s back as an entirely new thing!</p>



<p>Doesn&#8217;t give me a lot of faith in a website when they were once another thing entirely.</p>
