<p>Admittedly I went into Watchmen with high expectations. The <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/wb/watchmen/">trailers</a> were gorgeous, the hype was high, I&#8217;ve loved each movie based on a graphic novel I&#8217;ve seen and I <em>especially</em> loved 300. It would have been difficult for Watchmen to be anything but a disappointment.</p>



<p>The music, montages, scenes and costumes were all beautiful. The story was long and complicated. So complicated that I still don&#8217;t understand basics like how Rorschach or Laurie Juspeczyk became part of the Watchmen (or is it the Minutemen?) while some left (Hooded Justice) and others stayed (The Comedian).</p>



<p>Rorschach was a great character, especially in the jail scenes. Dr Manhattan was refreshingly different to God-like characters in other stories. Nite Owl was a pathetic loser who I didn&#8217;t care for at all.</p>



<p>In the end it felt like the best was made of what (I imagine) is a pretty complex story not suited to cinema.</p>
