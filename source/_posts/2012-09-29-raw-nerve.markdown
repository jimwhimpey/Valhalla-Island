Raw Thought by Aaron Swartz is my favourite blog. Over the last two months he's been writing an excellent series of articles on "getting better at life". It's called [Raw Nerve](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/rawnerve) and I've been looking forward to each new piece. Aaron is [well read](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/books2011) and backs his advice with real research which he's often personally implemented in his own life. 

Knowing that writing helps me organise and understand my thoughts on a subject and in an effort to better internalise Aaron's lessons here's my own short summary of each Raw Nerve piece.

[Take a step back](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/stepback)

There are many more options than you might immediately see or consider. Don't be fooled into thinking choices are binary (eg. should I stay in this job *or* take this new job). You can invent new options and it will make you feel in control of your life rather than trekking down a series of forks in the road.

[Believe you can change](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/dweck)

Believing intelligence can be grown with work and perseverance is a self-fulfilling prophecy. It puts you in a growth mindset where you're willing to tackle problems because you know it'll improve you and the result is that *it does*. Believing that you are any one thing (dumb, introverted, slow, etc.) and there's nothing you can do about it is what's making you that way.

[Look at yourself objectively](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/semmelweis)

Sure it sucks to be told about a flaw in yourself but it's much worse to continue with that flaw for the rest of your life. Seek out and embrace honest criticism, face and deal with your flaws. It is better than temporary shame or embarrassment. 

[Lean into the pain](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/dalio)

Cognitive and physical strength work the same way; pushing your limits to a painful level makes you stronger. Shying away from a difficult mental problem is like abandoning your run or putting away the weights at the first feeling of burn. Don't allow what you're already good at to become a fence around potential new experiences or growth.

[Confront reality](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/anders)

Doing things that are so grandiose it'll be impossible tell if it fails is avoiding failure as much as doing something very easy.

[Cherish mistakes](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/geremiah)

Analyse mistakes to find out what really went wrong. It may be several levels deeper than where it first appears and your solution may be nothing but a band aid. Write it down. It's hugely advantageous to avoid making the same mistake multiple times.

[Fix the machine, not the person](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/nummi)

It's unlikely people around you *enjoy* being annoying or doing a bad job. Rather than admonishing them or writing them off as a terrible person apply what you know about yourself, that you can get better, and do what you can to change the situation around them to improve things for both of you.
