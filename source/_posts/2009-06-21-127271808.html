<p><a href="http://feedafever.com/">Fever Feed Reader</a></p><p>From the <a href="http://shauninman.com/pact/">same dude</a> who makes the excellent <a href="http://haveamint.com/">Mint</a> website stats tool and designed around the same self hosted model. The self-hosted model works for Mint because needing it almost always means you&#8217;re already running similar software on your own server. For a standalone application like a feed reader I think it&#8217;s much less of a good idea. Even I, someone with experience in and totally comfortable with fucking around on a web server, don&#8217;t want to deal with the hassle of self-hosting an application. For anyone less technically equipped it could be a frustratingly difficult process to simply get it up and running.</p>



<p>Freeing myself of the burden of managing a self-hosted WordPress install was the number one reason I switched to Tumblr. I&#8217;ve been a much happier blogger ever since.</p>
