<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrhDaAmn5Uw">IBM Centennial Film: They Were There</a><br/><p>A compelling short movie directed by Errol Morris with gorgeous music by Phillip Glass to commemorate IBM&#8217;s 100th birthday. IBM is an incredibly vast and eclectic company, I think of them as a hyperactive Apple. It&#8217;s full of great quotes like this:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>And now barcodes are everywhere.</p>

<p>Well worth the 30 minutes. Via <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/01/21/they-were-there">Daring Fireball</a></p>
