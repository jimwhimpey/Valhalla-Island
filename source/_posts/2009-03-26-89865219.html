  <p>“I’m looking at islands in the north, around Iceland, because no one will think of looking for anyone there,” Spencer said, his thick lips spreading into a self-satisfied smile. “If I can get some other B people [billionaires] to go there with me, we can build underground homes and use geothermal energy.”</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a gimmicky title but judging by the excerpts, it sounds great. The problem with books (or websites or guides or classes) on this subject is that they&#8217;re based heavily on secrets which cease to be secrets once they&#8217;re published internationally. A St Kitts passport might have worked wonders a few years ago but what happens when tens of thousands of American citizens start applying for them?</p>
