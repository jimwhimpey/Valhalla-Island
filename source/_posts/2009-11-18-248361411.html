title: "Microsoft Store breaks out into song"

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSAXEVXvNz8">Microsoft Store breaks out into song</a><br/><p>I <em>know</em> it&#8217;s obvious what&#8217;s wrong with this but I can&#8217;t help but talk about it, I&#8217;m <em>facinated</em>.</p>



<p>As a customer this would do nothing but annoy me. You&#8217;re trying to buy a computer and every member of the <em>huge</em> staff breaks out into a repetitive dance for <em>4 minutes</em>. I understand a computer is a big purchase but imagine trying to buy a sandwich and having the cashier dance for even <em>10 seconds</em>. It would be maddening, in both situations.</p>



<p>Speed and service are the qualities I appreciate in a retail store. Microsoft is trying to be fun, a quality no one cares about when buying things (and which Microsoft fails to achieve with their embarrassing dance <em>anyway</em>), at the expense of both.</p>



<p>From what I can see, Microsoft spends 5% of it&#8217;s resources developing a shitty operating system and the remaining 95% on ill conceived ideas to convince people to buy it anyway.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve said similar things <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/194962900">before</a>. Even if Windows seemed like a decent piece of software, I would be wary of it knowing that the <em>same company</em> thinks pulling ridiculous shit like Windows 7 launch parties and dance routines in its stores are a good idea.</p>
