<p>I am pro union because I am pro people. Profits to a non-human legal entity at the expense of <em>actual people</em> (or safety, or a quality experience) is crazy and it blows my mind that any <em>person</em>  could think another way.</p>



<p>One of the bridesmaids at the wedding reception I was at last night was flying home to the US at 11am the next day. At around 11pm she found out <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-10-29/qantas-locking-out-staff/3608250">Alan Joyce ordered the grounding of Qantas&#8217; entire fleet</a>. By around 1am, after furious back and forth on the phone at her best friend&#8217;s wedding, she&#8217;d organised an alternative flight on Virgin that left in just 5 hours.</p>



<p>This is what Joyce has chosen to do to 10s of 1000s of passengers instead of keeping Australia&#8217;s airline jobs <em>in Australia</em> and paying workers like pilots and engineers, who are responsible for people&#8217;s safety, what they&#8217;re worth. Refusing to even negotiate with the unions has already cost Qantas a huge portion of what the unions&#8217; demands would cost, and that&#8217;s not to mention the 1000s of customers plans thrown into disarray. Grounding the whole fleet is costing $20m <em>each day</em> while destroying <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-10-30/irate-passengers-vow-to-abandon-qantas/3608640">Qantas&#8217; reputation</a>.</p>



<p>Alan Kohler opened with a great question on <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-10-30/joyce-defends-qantas-grounding/3608780">Inside Business this morning</a>:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Alan Joyce, you said yesterday that the industrial action was killing Qantas slowly, have you decided to kill it quickly instead?</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Meanwhile, just two days ago, <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-10-28/qantas-shareholders-vote-in-favour-of-pay-rise-for/3607222?section=business">shareholders inexplicably voted to give Joyce at 70% pay rise to $5m</a>. The absurdity of this situation is mind boggling. <a href="http://www.facebook.com/Qantas">There&#8217;s a new spirit</a> indeed, a spirit of fucking people over.</p>
