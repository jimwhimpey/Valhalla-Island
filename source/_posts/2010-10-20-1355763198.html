<blockquote>

  <p>The professor, who admitted to being a little lax when it came to backing up data on his laptop, had left the bag hidden behind the stairwell of his apartment block when he made a short detour to the laundry room. Soon after, he realised his bag had vanished along with ten years of precious data.

  [&#8230;]

  The calendar is extremely important. It is my life. Here I have documented the last ten years and beyond,‚Äù he said.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>This professor is not only reckless enough to keep a <em>single copy</em> of his entire life&#8217;s work on a laptop but he then thinks it&#8217;ll be safe to temporarily &#8220;hide it&#8221; in a semi-public place while he does his laundry. He didn&#8217;t deserve to have his data returned.</p>
