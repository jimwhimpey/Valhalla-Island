<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbizzLzcpnM">Sherri Shepherd Doesn't Know Whether the Earth is Flat</a></p><p>I know this is old but it blows my mind. Without knowing the world is round how do you comprehend the sun rising and setting? The moon&#8217;s position in the sky? The stars? How do seasons happen? Why is it colder or hotter is some places to others? Why do time zones exist? What&#8217;s the horizon? Where <em>is</em> the earth in the grander scheme of things?</p>



<p>Ironically, while she&#8217;s completely ignorant of these real world <em>facts</em> that surround and affect her life, Shepherd wholeheartedly believes in God. Seems there&#8217;s a significant correlation between ignorance and religion.</p>
