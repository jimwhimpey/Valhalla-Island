A beta of the next major version was released recently and with it, a companion iPhone application. Exciting stuff if you&#8217;re a long time Cha-Ching user hoping for more.</p>



<p>Despite the gaps and room for improvement in the first version, the most notable feature in the new beta is <strong>to dos</strong>. To dos barely belong in iCal. Incredibly, they were added to Mail and now <em>Cha-Ching</em>, a finance application, has integrated to do management. Think of any two, unrelated applications and integrate their functionality: instant messaging in Photoshop, web browsing into iTunes or feed reading into TextMate, that&#8217;s how much sense it makes. There&#8217;s already a slew of great, dedicated to do applications out there, the functionality already exists in two applications that ship with OS X (not that it should).</p>



<p>I emailed Midnight Apps with my thoughts. They argue that there&#8217;s tasks like paying bills that relate to finance so it makes sense to have to do management integrated with a finance application. The majority of my 900 completed tasks recorded in <a href="http://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a>, a dedicated to do application, are completed in TextMate, Safari and the Terminal, all manage fine without a built-in to do manager. I appreciate their focus on what they&#8217;re good at while separately Things does what it&#8217;s good at.</p>



<p>I want to listen to music while I edit photos, compose email and browse the web, would it make sense to add an MP3 player to Photoshop, another to Mail and have Safari implement its own too? The same goes for task management.</p>



<p>The to do UI in Cha-Ching is attractive and functional which makes it worse. To know that valuable development time and effort has been spent implementing a feature completely unrelated and unnecessary while there&#8217;s so much room for improvement in <em>finance</em>, the reason Cha-Ching exists in the first place, is extremely frustrating.</p>
