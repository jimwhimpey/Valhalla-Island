Use less materials, less electronics, strip it to its bare essentials and you have a car cheap to buy and cheap to run that even today is more practical and spacious than your modern sedan. It&#8217;s a shame they no longer make these, judging by the hugely inflated prices they go for second hand I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s a market for them.</p>
