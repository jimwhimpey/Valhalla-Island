<a href="http://fly.twitter.com/">New Twitter</a><br/><p>I&#8217;m seeing lots of talk about whether it actually is a simplification, who it&#8217;s for, which direction they&#8217;re going, what&#8217;s been demoted, what&#8217;s being emphasised, the confusing iPhone app, how horrible it is and how great it is.</p>



<p>Personally, I interact with Twitter exclusively via the API and third party applications (<a href="http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/">Tweetbot on iPhone</a> and <a href="http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific">Twitterrific for Mac</a>) where these issues don&#8217;t exist.</p>
