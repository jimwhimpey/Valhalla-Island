<p><a href="http://thecosmicmachine.com/">EventBox</a> is the non-HUD Twitter app I&#8217;ve been looking for. It has an incredible amount of configuration options which is great because I don&#8217;t care about Growl notifications, unread counts or the HUD component. As well as Twitter it handles a few other social networks side by side: Flickr and Facebook most notably.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s in beta so can be a little buggy, the text isn&#8217;t easy to read and I don&#8217;t like the way everything requires a read/unread status. I read everything from Twitter but definitely not from Facebook where I couldn&#8217;t care less if I&#8217;ve seen the update or not.</p>
