A never ridden, 2006, Trek Madone sporting the Dura-Ace 7800 groupset. It&#8217;s the kind of bike pros are still riding today and it was just luck and good timing that I was able to get it at a price within my budget. It was clear after only riding it the 5km home from the bike store that it&#8217;s lightyears ahead of anything I&#8217;ve ridden before.</p>



<p>For now I&#8217;m using quite a high raised stem to slowly ease my spine back into cycling.</p>
