<p>I really like the concept of creating rules to govern your life. It makes things simpler and decisions easier but 20 rules is <em>way</em> too many for <em>anything</em>. Here&#8217;s the three I&#8217;d limit it to:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Don&#8217;t eat anything that took more energy to ship than to grow.</p>

  

  <p>If you are not hungry enough to eat an apple, then you are not hungry.</p>

  

  <p>Don&#8217;t eat anything you aren&#8217;t willing to kill yourself.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Also, why is this content presented in Flash? Totally unnecessary.</p>
