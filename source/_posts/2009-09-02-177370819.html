<blockquote>One thing that was very clear after all these conversations about phones is that there is no “one size fits all” in this market. On Oct. 6th, you’ll see new Windows phones designed for a variety of tastes, needs and price points - with or without keyboards, with or without touch screens, as well as your choice of GPS, accelerometer and high resolution camera.</blockquote>&#8212;<p>This is what&#8217;s <a href="http://windowsteamblog.com/blogs/windowsphone/archive/2009/09/01/windows-phones-are-coming-on-october-6th.aspx">wrong</a> with Microsoft, why is there a choice of GPS, accelerometer and high resolution camera? Why would any one person not want one of those? There&#8217;s no downside. Are customers telling them &#8220;I would love GPS and an accelerometer but give me a <em>low resolution camera</em>, not that high resolution crap!&#8221;?</p>
