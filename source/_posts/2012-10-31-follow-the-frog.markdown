This commercial was [posted to Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/11w8s4/amazing_commercial_you_cannot_stop_watching/) with the title "Amazing commercial you cannot stop watching". I think it sucks.

It would be silly to uproot your life to lead an uprising against logging companies in Nicaragua, wouldn't it!? Yeah! Well, just *buy these products* and you are absolved. Ahh, a clear and at peace conscience.

It's like telling an obese person they're never going to exercise *six hours a day*, that's *crazy*, just eat these weight loss chocolate bars. A kind of [straw man](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man) logical fallacy.

Quitting your job and moving to the jungle is dumb and ineffectual but buying a Mars Bar with a special logo on it shouldn't release you of all other responsibility. A certain level of guilt is good. It forces you to be conscious of the results of your actions in all parts of your life.

I don't like anything that sells itself as a golden bullet to any significantly large problem. Especially when the golden bullet is *buying stuff*.
