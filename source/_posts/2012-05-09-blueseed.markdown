Blueseed is an idea to fit out a ship off the coast of California in international waters that will allow "boldest, brightest, and most talented tech entrepreneurs" to start a business with little immigration overhead.

If this ridiculous idea got off the ground it would be the physical manifestation of the life destroying culture of working 
yourself into the ground to make a startup succeed. That is, get acquired. I can't think of anything I'd want less than to 
isolate myself on an island, 
bunking with four others in a tiny space while working in an environment where I'm expected to give up everything to make a 
venture capitalist rich.

What a nightmare.
