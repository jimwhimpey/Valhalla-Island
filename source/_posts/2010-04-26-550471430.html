<blockquote>The sport walks a balancing act between credibility and cleanliness. The stronger it tests, the more busts, the cleaner it gets, but the dirtier it looks.</blockquote>&#8212;<p>Astute words from Cycling Tips commenter Bob on convicted drug cheat <a href="http://www.cyclingtipsblog.com/2010/04/l-b-l/">Vinokourov&#8217;s Liege-Bastogne-Li√®ge win</a>.</p>



<p>No penalty is too harsh for the damage riders like Vinokourov have done to cycling&#8217;s reputation. He deserved a lifetime ban and as far as I&#8217;m concerned he didn&#8217;t win last night.</p>
