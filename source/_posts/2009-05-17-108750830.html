<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/12/science/earth/12suburb.html?_r=4&amp;pagewanted=all">Vauban, A Town Without Cars</a><br/><p>So many ideas coming together to make for a less polluted, safer, quieter, more social, healthy and liveable town. I&#8217;d never considered that things like zoning laws to separate the residential from commercial so heavily encourage car use. Some great photos and extra information in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2009/05/12/science/20090512-SUBURB_index.html">the slideshow</a>.</p>
