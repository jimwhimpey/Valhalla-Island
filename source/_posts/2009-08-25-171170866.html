<p>I remember seeing Brant Webb and Todd Russell striding out of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaconsfield_Mine_collapse">Beaconsfield Mine</a> after 14 nights trapped in a their tiny underground cage. How they were able survive let alone come out looking so fresh and with such high spirits still amazes me.</p>
