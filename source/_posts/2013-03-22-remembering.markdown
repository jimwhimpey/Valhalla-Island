I was talking with a friend yesterday about sentimentality. She told me about a Journey concert t-shirt she's kept from years ago because it reminds her of a fun night. I don't share this mindset at all and it reminded my of a [great post by Jack Shedd written almost three years ago](http://www.bigcontrarian.com/2010/07/06/pictures/) about photographs:

>  I don’t want to stare at some photo of me at 21 when I’m 50 and contemplate everything I was, or could have been. I don’t want to have to drown in partial truths, grasping at a falling memory to paint in details. I’d rather either remember, or not. Rather know, or forget.

This is how I feel.

There is no value in reminding yourself of something you would have otherwise naturally forgot if not for an artifact you've kept for that purpose alone. The truly defining moments of your life you will remember; photographs, t-shirts or not.
