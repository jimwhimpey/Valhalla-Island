<p>This is an interesting car with an interesting website.</p>



<p>After sitting through the intro animation and navigating around for a few moments you might find yourself frustrated by the gratuitous animation and strange abstract menu structure with tiny hit areas. All the stuff usually found in Flash websites made by people unconvinced HTML could possibly provide the platform this breakthrough product deserves.</p>



<p>But aside from the opening animation the Nissan Leaf&#8217;s website <em>is</em> HTML.</p>



<p>Which is impressive.</p>



<p>The same way <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvL89EpoLNQ">squirting milk out of an eye socket</a> is impressive.</p>



<p>Impressive but gross.</p>
