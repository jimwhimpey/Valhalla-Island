I love the way Norris McWhirter, the stadium announcer on the day, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Bannister#The_4-minute_mile">famously drew out</a> the world record announcement:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Ladies and gentlemen, here is the result of event 9, the one-mile: 1st, No. 41, R.G. Bannister, Amateur Athletic Association and formerly of Exeter and Merton Colleges, Oxford, with a time which is a new meeting and track record, and which - subject to ratification - will be a new English Native, British National, All-Comers, European, British Empire, and World Record. The time was 3&#8230;</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Before being drowned out by cheers. I get goosebumps just reading it.</p>
