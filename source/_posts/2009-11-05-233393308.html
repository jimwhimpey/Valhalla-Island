<p>Is there anyone out there tech savvy or nerdy enough to be aware of and willing to buy a separate, additional <a href="http://www.amazon.com/iPhone-Missing-Manual-David-Pogue/dp/0596513747">Missing Manual for iPhone</a> but not tech savvy enough to simply play with the phone or browse the web to learn what it can do?</p>



<p>People who need a manual don&#8217;t care enough to buy an additional book meticulously explaining their device&#8217;s feature set.</p>



<p>And people who do want to know their device inside out can easily learn it themselves.</p>



<p>Who are these missing manual books for?</p>
