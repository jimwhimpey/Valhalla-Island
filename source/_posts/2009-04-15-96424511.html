<a href="http://static.jimwhimpey.com/images/apartment-map.png"><img src="/assets/tumblr/oaQecruTZmbfwpjykTtJ1k1jo1_500.png"/></a><br/><p>This map may look biased towards being close to my work but it really only covers about a 10km radius around the city, we don&#8217;t want to be in the CBD and my work just happens to be in a nice area.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re looking to rent a two bedroom apartment for around $400/week but our <strong>number one priority</strong> is close location to work. The green areas are all close. Our list of travel options in my order of preference:</p>



<ol><li>Cycling</li>

<li>Walking</li>

<li>Ferry (The City Cat, which <a href="http://www.monocle.com/webprogrammes/Quality-of-Life-Index/CityCat-Brisbane/">Monocle rates highly</a>)</li>

<li>Train with no transfers</li>

</ol><p>If I can&#8217;t commute to work within 15 or 20 minutes each way using those modes of transport the place isn&#8217;t suitable. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve chosen the areas we have. There&#8217;s a huge abundance of dedicated bike paths, train lines and ferry terminals lining the river.</p>
