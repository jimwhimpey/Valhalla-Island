<a href="http://blog.ted.com/2011/08/08/the-shareable-future-of-cities-alex-steffen-on-ted-com/">The Shareable Future of Cities</a><br/><p>Alex Steffen makes the eloquent case against simply using clean energy to solve our climate problem.</p>



<p>This explains why, even if electric cars were readily available and they could be charged on 100% clean energy I have very little interest in owning one despite not owning a car now partially for environmental reasons. I would much rather (and do) live close to the things I need and want to do. Electric or not, cars are backed up from my house to the city each morning. I pass hundreds of gridlocked cars on my 7 minute bike ride to work, they&#8217;re already unsustainable.</p>



<p>He ends with this great quote:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Because right now our economy by and large operates as Paul Hawkins said by stealing the future, selling it in the present and calling it GDP.</p>

</blockquote>
