<p>It&#8217;s already too expensive for me to personally justify owning a car and it&#8217;s only going to get <a href="http://abc.net.au/news/stories/2011/03/31/3178981.htm">more</a> and <a href="http://abc.net.au/news/stories/2011/04/28/3202209.htm">more</a> expensive. Most seem to treat driving like a God-given right and choose to complain about the price rather than do something about it. I&#8217;m interested in how expensive it has to get before people start questioning its viability.</p>
