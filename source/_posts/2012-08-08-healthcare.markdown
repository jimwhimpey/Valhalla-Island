> I simply went without health insurance for awhile to finish Birdfeed (it’s shockingly expensive in New York State—far more even than, say, California), and I know a surprising number of my peers in the indie Mac/iOS community have done the same thing at various points. And we’re the crazy ones. I guarantee you a lot of people are too scared by the cost of health care to even consider starting their own businesses.

Having been born and grown up in [a country](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia) that provides free healthcare to all its citizens, having seen the care provided to almost everyone I know and [myself personally](http://valhallaisland.com/blog/2009/141205452/) (warning: a little gore) over the years, it is difficult for me to even comprehend the idea of going without health insurance in the USA.

If I understand the situation correctly, when a US citizen gets sick or injured without insurance, they have a choice between getting zero treatment, and therefore potential death or lifetime disability, or complete financial ruin.

Even if they have insurance, the insurance provider is a huge corporation who's profits depend on *not providing coverage*.

I still can't fathom it.
