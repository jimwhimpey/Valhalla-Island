  <p>Which brings me to the problem with this campaign. Who on earth would become a Comcast enthusiast? Who hangs out at a Comcast Web site and rearranges pretend furniture? Or, put more broadly: What sane person forms a loving attachment to a cable behemoth?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2213793/">Slate</a> on Comcast&#8217;s meaningless and somewhat creepy <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYWxV_gR9ro&amp;fmt=18">dream big commercial</a>.</p>



<p>The marketing department and rest of the company work in opposition. The company&#8217;s products fail and the service sucks. Consumers hate the company. Nothing but bad experiences come to mind when thinking of the company. What&#8217;s the solution? Make a fucking commercial full of people in a miniature animated world singing about how great the company is. Finish it with &#8216;DREAM BIG&#8217;, a slogan contrived and meaningless in <em>any situation</em> let alone when related to a cable provider.</p>



<p>Ditch the bullshit marketing, invest the money in great service and making a great product and the marketing will take care of itself.</p>
