<a href="http://tumblrthemr.icelab.com.au/"><img src="/assets/tumblr/tumblr_lihmtrC1Gp1qzwfbio1_500.png"/></a><br/><p>For the past few months the guys from <a href="http://icelab.com.au/">Icelab</a> (particularly, <a href="http://makenosound.com/">Max Wheeler</a>) and I have been working on something to solve a personal itch: the lack of local Tumblr theme development.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not a 100% complete solution and the hoops we&#8217;ve jumped through to make it work as well is it does are large and plentiful but I can attest that <a href="http://tumblrthemr.icelab.com.au/">TumblrThemr</a> makes developing Tumblr themes a hell of a lot more enjoyable.</p>
