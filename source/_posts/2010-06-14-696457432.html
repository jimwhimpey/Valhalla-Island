title: "Ira Glass on Begging"

<p>From the latest spiel Glass has been giving about donations at the opening of every <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/?bypass=true">This American Life podcast</a> for the last few months:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Second question, we get this a lot, why don&#8217;t we just charge for the podcast? The answer is we don&#8217;t want to because fewer people would actually hear the podcast. We like it to be free. Idealistically we like the idea that it should be possible to do ambitious stories and try things that no one else is doing on radio and in podcasts and pay for the whole thing by asking the people who listen to kick in a couple of bucks each. I believe in that. I&#8217;ve thrown money at podcasts I like, it&#8217;s still really cheap entertainment. If that&#8217;s going to be the future of media, I like that future.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>This is the <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/292829693">question I asked</a> five months ago and this answer doesn&#8217;t satisfy me.</p>



<p>Charging for the podcast <em>is</em> asking for money. A future where you can independently  produce original, creative entertainment (or anything) and make a living from it <em>without</em> the need to beg for donations is a future I like.</p>
