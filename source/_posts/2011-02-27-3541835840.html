<p>I&#8217;ve linked to this sublime video <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/707505767">before</a> but after watching it again today I can&#8217;t help but post it again. Even if you hate ironing (which I don&#8217;t, I love it) you can appreciate watching someone use the right tools to complete a job with precision and speed. I&#8217;d love to know where you can get an ironing board (desk?) and iron setup like that.</p>
