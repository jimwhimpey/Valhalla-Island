<a href="http://www.adobe.com/choice/">Adobe®: We Love Choice</a><br/><p>The $600 Flash authoring tool is the only way to produce Flash applications.</p>



<p>The free Mac OS X Developer tools (that require an $800+ Mac computer) are the only way to produce iPhone and iPad applications.</p>



<p>Both systems are as closed as each other.</p>



<p>Adobe claims Flash is open.</p>



<p>Apple makes no such claims. If you want to make iPhone or iPad apps you use Mac OS and Xcode, take it or leave it.</p>



<p>If you choose to leave it the alternative is HTML. A <em>truly</em> open platform for which authoring is as simple as editing text. There&#8217;s many HTML rendering engine implementations, the best few are totally open source with Apple being the major contributor to the best one, WebKit.</p>



<p>Adobe: not open, claim to be.</p>



<p>Apple: not open, don&#8217;t claim to be, contribute heavily to that which is truly open.</p>



<p><strong>Update</strong></p>



<p>As many Daring Fireball readers have pointed out to me via email, I was wrong about Flash (the authoring tool) being the only way to publish SWF files.</p>



<p>SWF is a standard that Adobe has published information on how to produce. However, Flash (the player) is the only appication that can interpret SWF files and my closing point stands.</p>
