<img src="/assets/tumblr/tumblr_l44pymjKvE1qzwfbio1_400.png"/><br/><p>A URL field pre-filled with a &#8216;http://&#8217; which doesn&#8217;t disappear on focus is a terrible UI convention.</p>



<p>No one types out URLs so contrary to its intended purpose it adds time to completing the field because you have to delete the existing http:// before pasting in your own already http:// prefixed URL.</p>
