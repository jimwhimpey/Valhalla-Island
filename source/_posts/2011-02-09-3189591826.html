<blockquote>Everyone gets their own private office. Shut the door and you won&#8217;t be bothered. Lunches are free, catered and we all eat together every day.</blockquote>&#8212;From Campaign Monitor&#8217;s gorgeous <a href="http://www.campaignmonitor.com/hiring/">now hiring page</a>. I don&#8217;t know why &#8220;open plan&#8221; is still considered the ideal office setup. Individual offices don&#8217;t create a cold anti social environment, they&#8217;re quiet, allow people to concentrate and don&#8217;t preclude face to face conversation. Campaign Monitor looks like it&#8217;d be one of the best places in Australia for a developer or designer to work.
