Last week's This American Life podcast episode, a rerun from 1997, was all about [conventions](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/74/conventions). At 37:38 starts the saddest story I have ever heard, bizarrely starting at a NeXT convention and a Steve Jobs comedy roast. I'm not sure why this story hits my usually somewhat callous heart so hard but I was deeply moved.
