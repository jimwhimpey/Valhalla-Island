title: "Radtech's Full Screen Noise Filter"
---

<p>I prefer a glossy screen over matte for the rich colour and super brightness. If it&#8217;s up to me, which it usually is, I&#8217;m not computing in a brightly lit area so glare and reflections are not an issue. At work however it&#8217;s not up to me, the bright fluorescent lighting is unavoidable and when using a glossy screen there&#8217;s glare and reflections.</p>



<p>To combat the glare at work I bought a <a href="http://www.radtech.us/Products/ClearCal-Displays.aspx">ClearCal Anti-Glare film from Radtech</a> and it arrived today. I spent 5 minutes going through the (expectedly) painful process of applying it to the screen, left it on for five minutes, then peeled it off and threw it in the bin.</p>



<p>It no doubt killed the glare but with it was a fine layer of distortion or noise covering the screen making everything slightly blurry and making text difficult to read. A co-worker likened it to removing the anti-aliasing from everything on the screen. It looked <em>terrible</em> and gave me a headache. I tried to tell myself to just live with it for a day or two and allow myself to potentially warm to it but I couldn&#8217;t, it had to go.</p>



<p>The one positive to come from it was that as far as screen problems go, now the glare doesn&#8217;t seem so bad.</p>
