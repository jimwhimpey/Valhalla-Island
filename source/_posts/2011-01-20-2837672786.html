title: "The State of Wikipedia"

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXD1TRGafQ0&amp;hd=1">The State of Wikipedia</a><br/><p>Beautifully produced and succinct video on the state of Wikipedia. Narrated by Jimmy Wales himself who it happens has a great speaking voice. It occurs to me that this would make a great video explaining Wikipedia to less internet literate people.
