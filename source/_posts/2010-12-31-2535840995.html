title: "SSD Upgrade Benchmarks"
---

<p>I gave in to temptation and bought an SSD for my 13&#8221; Macbook Pro. It&#8217;s a 120GB OCZ Vertex II and I don&#8217;t have much of an idea where it ranks in the current SSD standings. Progress seems to be happening too quickly and information seems too fragmented to make researching it anything but an exhausting prospect.</p>



<p>The Macbook was previously using Apple&#8217;s stock 5400RPM drive. After messing around for a while it&#8217;s no doubt <em>much</em> faster in practice. It boots and is ready to use in half the time, big apps like creative suite start up in ~2 seconds, shut downs happen in ~3 seconds, small apps open instantly, in fact, I can open <em>every app</em> on my computer with them all ready to use in about ~45 seconds.</p>



<p>Before installing the SSD I took some benchmarks with the terrific <a href="http://www.xbench.com/">XBench</a> with the plan to benchmark again post installation. Here&#8217;s the results (values in MB/sec):</p>



<h3>Sequential</h3>



<ul><li>Write (4K blocks) — HDD: 45.99, SSD: 105.34 — <strong>2.29 times faster</strong></li>

<li>Write (256K blocks) — HDD: 37.91, SSD: 94.63 — <strong>2.46 times faster</strong></li>

<li>Read (4K blocks) — HDD: 11.67, SSD: 20.31 — <strong>1.74 times faster</strong></li>

<li>Read (256K blocks) — HDD: 44.97, SSD 87.04 — <strong>1.93 times faster</strong></li>

</ul><h3>Random</h3>



<ul><li>Write (4K blocks) — HDD: 0.92, SSD: 41.64 — <strong>45.26 times faster</strong></li>

<li>Write (256K blocks) — HDD 28.86, SSD: 91.42 — <strong>3.16 times faster</strong></li>

<li>Read (4K blocks) — HDD: 0.46, SSD: 14.89 — <strong>32.36 times faster</strong></li>

<li>Read (256K blocks) — HDD: 18.52, SSD 99.05 — <strong>5.34 times faster</strong></li>

</ul><p>An operating system and native application&#8217;s most common task, random small read/writes, are obviously where the SSD most excels but even in its weaker areas it&#8217;s still significantly faster.</p>



<p>SSDs have come down in price to a point where they&#8217;re feasible for everyone, not just nerds with nothing else to spend their disposable income on. Buy!</p>
