<blockquote>There are new phone books on my porch. I&#8217;m sure a triceratops listening to a Walkman and checking his AOL mail would find them very useful.</blockquote>&#8212;<a href="https://twitter.com/AinsleyofAttack/status/1050260967">Ainsley Drew</a>. Despite the internet, my Mum still pulls out a phone book and spends five minutes leafing through the pages to find a number. I hope it&#8217;s not long until they&#8217;re phased out completely, it&#8217;s such a massive waste of resources.
