<blockquote>For diamonds do appear to be, just like broken glass to me.</blockquote>&#8212;Quoting Panic at the Disco lyrics makes me feel 14 years old but this line resonates strongly with me. I don&#8217;t understand jewellery at all. I can&#8217;t think of a greater waste of money. Even watches, the only piece of jewellery with any practical utility whatsoever are too decorative and expensive to be worth it.
