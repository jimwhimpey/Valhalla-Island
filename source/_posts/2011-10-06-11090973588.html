<blockquote>When you&#8217;re young, you look at television and think, There&#8217;s a conspiracy. The networks have conspired to dumb us down. But when you get a little older, you realize that&#8217;s not true. The networks are in business to give people exactly what they want. That&#8217;s a far more depressing thought.</blockquote>&#8212;Steve Jobs saying what I think every time I watch commercial TV.
