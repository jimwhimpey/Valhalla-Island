  <p>Retirees Dick and Anne Saplata work out by walking around the largely empty halls of the Metcalf South Mall in Leawood, Kan. It’s likely to close soon, and there’s talk that a developer will raze the place. If the mall goes under, Dick Saplata asks, “where are we going to walk?”</p>

<p>How about outside, in the fresh air of your neighbourhood?</p>

  <p>“The most important fact about our shopping malls,” says social scientist Henry Fairlie, “is that we do not need most of what they sell.”</p>

<p>I fail to feel sympathy when something fails because it&#8217;s no longer sustainable to do or sell things no one needs. Malls are gross, I&#8217;m happy to see them go. Via <a href="http://www.marco.org/91621921">marco</a>.</p>
