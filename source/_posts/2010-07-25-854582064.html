<p><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/07/24/2963130.htm">Gillard pledges cash for clunkers scheme</a></p><p>To summarise, Gillard is proposing <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/07/25/2963409.htm">pulling money from 100% emission-free solar power schemes</a> to encourage people&#8217;s replacement of their heavy emission producing cars for slightly less heavy emission producing cars, a dependance on which causes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_the_automobile_on_societies">a number of emission-unrelated problems</a>.</p>



<p>Car manufactures will be doing backflips and punters will be stoked they can buy an expensive car even further out of their means.</p>



<p>A good time to remind my Australian readers that <a href="http://greens.org.au/">the Greens</a> are the only responsible way to vote in the upcoming election. They are not a one policy party, they have detailed, well organised and presented policies in all key areas <a href="http://greens.org.au/policies">published on their website</a>.</p>
