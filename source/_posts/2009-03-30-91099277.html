  <p>I love how Audi frames their brand as the rebel, the individual, the enemy of mediocrity and convention.</p>

<p>The way it&#8217;s been shot with fleeting split second images of the cars, the Audi black and the rest silver make it difficult to actually compare the cars. Here&#8217;s a side by side with the Audi Q5 and Lexus RX which from what I can tell is the other car featured in the commercial.</p>

<p>Sure, Audi markets themselves as a rebel, the enemy of convention but the truth is they&#8217;re making the same boring, almost identical cars as every other manufacturer.</p>
