<blockquote>And you&#8217;re seeing things like in the Melbourne bike hire scheme - it&#8217;s not working as well as it has in the rest of the world because people don&#8217;t walk around with a helmet just in case. You&#8217;ve got helmets creating a barrier to cycling, particularly spontaneous, short-trip cycling.</blockquote><p>Associate Professor Chris Rissel <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/08/16/2983587.htm">appealing for helmet laws to be scrapped</a>.</p>



<p>As someone who commutes exclusively by bike, trains and races a bike and has been <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/141205452">hit by a car</a> while riding a bike, I couldn&#8217;t agree more. Compulsory helmet laws are counter productive to cyclist safety.</p>



<p>The more cyclists on the road the more safe cycling infrastructure, the less motorists on the road, the more awareness of cyclists from motorists. The support for helmet laws seems to be from people who personally think cycling is very dangerous and wouldn&#8217;t go helmet-less themselves. A commenter on the article:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>I would not venture out on a bike without a helmet, given these road conditions. Australia needs a shift in attitude both towards the car and the bike before we can shed our helmet laws.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Repealing compulsory helmet laws <em>is</em> the shift in attitude Australia needs. The beauty of repealing the law is that if you want to wear a helmet, you can! I would certainly still wear a helmet during training rides and races but wouldn&#8217;t bother for the low speed, low traffic, extremely safe 1km ride to the shops or to a friend&#8217;s house.</p>



<p>The overwhelming evidence that no compulsory helmet laws dramatically encourage cycling and therefore make it safer is plain to see in countries like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-AbPav5E5M&amp;hd=1">the Netherlands</a> and Denmark.</p>
