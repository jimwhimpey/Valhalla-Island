<a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/video/2010/09/24/3021586.htm">Kerry O'Brien Leaves The 7.30 Report</a><br/><p>After 45 years in journalism and 15 years as the host of The 7.30 Report this is truly the end of an era. For as long as I can remember Kerry O&#8217;Brien has been the only journalist legitimately holding politicians feet to the fire.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s strange listening to Kerry on the other side of the table but there&#8217;s some great stuff in this interview with Colvin. In response to questions of his neutrality in the recent election campaign:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>I would think anybody who sat down and looked at playbacks of both sets of interviews that I did in that campaign would be rather embarrassed if they persisted with that line.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>And on interviewing John Howard:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>He was a tough person to interview. Much in the way that I would imagine it&#8217;d be like bowling to Geoff Boycott. In that he played a very straight bat and often a very defensive bat but if a loose ball came along he was very quick to dispatch it.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>What other national news program anchor would use a cricket analogy to describe 12 years of interviews with a Prime Minister? It&#8217;s people like Kerry O&#8217;Brien who make me proud to work for the ABC over any other media organisation.</p>
