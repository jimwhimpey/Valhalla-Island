<p><a href="http://flexibits.com/fantastical">Fantastical</a></p><p>Yet another calendar application which doesn&#8217;t address <a href="http://valhallaisland.com/post/1120483557">my</a> and <a href="http://www.marco.org/2010/03/28/more-ideas-than-time-logarithmic-calendar-view">Marco&#8217;s</a> biggest issue. Fantastical is certainly a nice supplement to iCal but it&#8217;s a shame that it&#8217;s a menu bar app (which I don&#8217;t like in general) and its scope is so limited.</p>
