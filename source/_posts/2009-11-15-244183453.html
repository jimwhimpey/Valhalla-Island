title: "The iMac versus the Mac Pro"

<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: This post includes an embedded table which lacks styles when viewed in the dashboard but which I&#8217;ve meticulously styled for <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/244183453">the post when viewed on the website</a>, I suggest you view it there.</em></p>



<p>I&#8217;m obsessed with the ideal setup. I try to milk the best out of the equipment I have and think a lot about how it could be improved as my situation changes and new technology is released.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve been more than satisfied with my 24&#8221; iMac at home for a long time but I feel like I&#8217;ve <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/194075509">outgrown it</a>. The Mac Pro was the next, extremely expensive, logical step. Until the 27&#8221; iMac arrived:</p>

<p>The iMac comes with a gorgeous, 27&#8221; LED backlit screen the likes of which you can&#8217;t even buy individually. The Mac Pro comes with no screen. The Mac Pro is expandable with PCI cards and hard disk slots. The cost of that expandability is $1900 and the best computer screen available.</p>



<p>For many the lack of expandability is a deal breaker. If expandability is not essential, the iMac is an easy choice and I imagine many Mac Pro users will defect to the iMac come upgrade time.</p>



<p>Expandability is not essential for me but it&#8217;s desirable. Evidently Apple is able to sell a computer with the power of the Mac Pro for much less than $4,499. I wish they&#8217;d put it in the Mac Pro&#8217;s expandable case and sell it at or below the iMac&#8217;s fantastic price.</p>
