<a href="http://abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/09/18/2689697.htm">Huge population boom a massive challenge</a><br/><p>Says the treasurer of our nation, a nation that hands out a $5000 &#8220;baby bonus&#8221; for having a child and gives tax benefits to families defined by the number of children they have. Population is growing too fast <em>organically</em> without encouragement, I have never understood the Australian government&#8217;s obsession with population growth.</p>
