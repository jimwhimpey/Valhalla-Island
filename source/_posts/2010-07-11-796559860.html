<blockquote>iPhone 3G horribly slow after the iOS 4 update? Back up and restore. Totally fixed mine.</blockquote>I can confirm this information from <a href="http://twitter.com/waxpancake/status/18065397473">Andy Baio</a>. The speed isn&#8217;t earth shattering, as it wasn&#8217;t on 3.x, but it&#8217;s definitely back to pre-iOS 4 levels. I&#8217;d been really resenting the iOS 4 update and had been dying for the iPhone 4 to be released in Australia up until now.
