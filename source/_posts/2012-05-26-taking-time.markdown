The most good and worthwhile things in life take time. Often a lot of time. Relationships, fitness, education, businesses, projects are all rewarded by consistent time investment and become more valuable as time's invested.

You should never shy away from something because it'll take a lot of time and you should spend a great deal of time on things you already know are good because they'll only get better.
