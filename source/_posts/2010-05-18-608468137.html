  <p>Starting today, I’m joining <a href="http://banksimple.net/">BankSimple</a> as a co-founder, with the role of Chief Product &amp; Technology Officer. In a nutshell, I’m going to make sure we build something that’s simple, beautiful, and works really really well.</p>

<p>This is really exciting even though it&#8217;s unlikely BankSimple will stretch outside the US.</p>



<p>Industries like banking are ripe for smart people like Alex Payne to come in and do things <em>right</em>. Fundamentally banking is a simple concept and if you have the capital to begin with surely it&#8217;s possible to make a lot of money without the need to gouge your customers or skimp on things like support and a really good website.</p>



<p>Next please: insurance, real estate, air travel, postal service, supermarkets, etc.</p>



<p>Sidenote: Why do all names of things now have to be a single camel cased &#8220;word&#8221;? Why is BankSimple &#8220;BankSimple&#8221; and not the much more aesthetically pleasing and grammatically correct &#8220;Bank Simple&#8221;?</p>
