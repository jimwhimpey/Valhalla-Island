title: "How To Buy Things"
---

<ol><li>When you see something you want don&#8217;t buy it. </li>

<li>Instead add it to a list.</li>

<li>Every few weeks review the list, remove the things you no longer need or want.</li>

<li>If you have the urge to impulse buy something because it&#8217;s on special, don&#8217;t buy it if it&#8217;s not on the list, optionally add it to the list.</li>

<li>If something on the list is on special or has remained on the list after multiple reviews, buy it.</li>

</ol><p>I&#8217;ve used this system for a couple of years and it works well. Over time I&#8217;ve avoided buying 1000s of dollars worth of stuff that, as time has passed, I&#8217;ve realised I don&#8217;t need or want.</p>
