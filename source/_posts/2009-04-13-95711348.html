title: Translations from Park Slope real-estate listings to real life
---

<a href="http://www.marco.org/95613967">Translations from Park Slope real-estate listings to real life</a><br/><p>I&#8217;m really enjoying Marco&#8217;s series on looking for an apartment to rent. Despite being on opposite sides of the planet I think we&#8217;re looking for a pretty similar type of place.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re a month off seriously looking for a place but from just a few hours browsing the listings on <a href="http://www.realestate.com.au/">realestate.com.au</a> and <a href="http://www.domain.com.au/">Domain</a> the ridiculous &#8220;sales&#8221; tactics (or complete incompetence) of real estate agents is obvious. The amount of listings with a single photo of the view or the exterior of an apartment building <em>and nothing else</em> is incredible. Then there&#8217;s the listings without any photos at all or with photos so low in resolution and quality it&#8217;s impossible to tell what colour the carpet is or whether the floor&#8217;s carpeted at all.</p>
