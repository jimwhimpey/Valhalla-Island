<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/6612641">Zune HD Ads on App Launch</a></p><p>I <em>hate</em> ad supported software. If it&#8217;s an app I love I want to pay for it, if I don&#8217;t totally love it and it&#8217;s ad supported with no option I won&#8217;t use it. I don&#8217;t want my experience degraded by having ads shoved down my throat nor do I want the burden of ignoring them.</p>



<p>This is the most extreme form of ad supported software I&#8217;ve seen. It blows my mind how horrible this is. It shows complete disrespect for the user&#8217;s time. Microsoft have obviously written off the Zune as a great handheld media player and see it just as a tiny screen they can use to infiltrate people&#8217;s lives with advertising. How <em>embarrassing</em> it must be to own a Zune. Via <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/09/17/zune-hd">Daring Fireball</a>.</p>
