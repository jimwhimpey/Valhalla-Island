<p>I love Andre Torrez&#8217;s <a href="http://notes.torrez.org/2009/12/resolutions-2010.html">new year&#8217;s resolution idea</a>:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>So then it hit me: what if I only listened to music released in 2010? Okay.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>As much as the thought of not listening to my favourite music for a year sucks, my entire library feels stale. Despite the magic of <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/fightingfriends">last.fm</a> and iTunes Genius I struggle to find new music I like.</p>



<p>The idea of forcing yourself to actively search for new things to like really appeals to me. It&#8217;s too easy to get stuck in a comfortable bubble, endeavours like this push you out.</p>



<p>As it stands I&#8217;m over the moon when I hear a favourite song that I haven&#8217;t personally cued up. I imagine this effect would be amplified many times over when you haven&#8217;t heard any of your old favourites in months. I&#8217;d get excited again with the anticipation of a new realise from a favourite band. At the end of it all you&#8217;ve got a brand new set of artists you enjoy and songs you&#8217;d listened to over 100 times in the preceding years would feel fresh again. It&#8217;s a fantastic idea.</p>



<p>I make a point of only making a single resolution each year. I&#8217;ve got a week and a bit to think about whether this&#8217;ll be it.</p>
