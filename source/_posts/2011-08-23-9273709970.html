<blockquote>

  <p>It&#8217;s incredible how badly big companies are boning themselves in this tablet business.</p>

<p>Everything about this page is amazing.</p>



<ol><li>The only picture of the device on the page is a tiny thumbnail.</li>

<li>It&#8217;s followed by a <em>16 minute</em> video of a middle-aged executive talking into the camera from a teleprompter in a monotonous drone of enterprise doublespeak with an &#8217;80s infomercial backdrop.</li>

<li>The video is <em>tiny</em>.</li>

<li>The featured content area at the bottom of the page looks <em>exactly</em> like a block of Google text ads.</li>

</ol><p>Compare and contrast with Apple&#8217;s <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/">iPad page</a>. I know they&#8217;re aimed at different markets but who the hell would feel compelled to buy a bunch of Cisco Cius units for their business after getting &#8220;sold&#8221; by Cisco&#8217;s &#8220;marketing&#8221; here.</p>
