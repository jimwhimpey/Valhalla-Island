<a href="http://www.rockmelt.com/">RockMelt</a><br/><p>First it was <a href="http://flock.com/">Flock</a> now RockMelt is adding bullshit to browser chrome. I can&#8217;t even think of an analogy for <em>adding a subset of a website to the chrome of software made for accessing the same complete websites as its primary functionality</em>.</p>



<p>A car with another smaller car inside it that doesn&#8217;t go as fast or as far?</p>



<p>The list of features in the screenshot — share easily, connect with friends, search faster, keep up on news — are all things any browser can do today by simply <em>visiting websites</em>. It&#8217;s impossible to tell what those avatars down the left hand edge represent but why would you ever want a row of faces constantly staring back at you while you&#8217;re browsing?</p>



<p>Shit like this seems to be a momentum gaining trend of social media being treated as though it has inherent value. The &#8220;features&#8221; RockMelt adds to Chrome may not be useful and they may actually detract from the web browsing experience but because it&#8217;s social media it&#8217;s considered valuable.</p>
