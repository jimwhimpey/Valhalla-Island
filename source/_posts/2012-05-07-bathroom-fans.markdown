Marco Arment as part of his argument for writing posts about bathroom fans and pillowcasing strategies:

> Installing timer switches on my bathroom fans has eliminated a *daily* annoyance from my life. Deciding on a pillowcasing strategy has made me sleep more comfortably *every night* since I wrote that stupid article seven years ago.

I'm with Marco. Finding ways to automate and streamline parts of your life should be a continual pursuit. Think about how many times you've lost your keys and how much time and frustration you'd have saved if years ago you purposefully decided you were going to put your keys in the same place every day forever.
