<a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2011/04/29/the-book-is-dead">The "Book" is Dead</a><br/><p>Mark Pilgram on David Flanagan <a href="http://www.davidflanagan.com/2011/04/javascript-the-1.html">having to get a salaried job</a> after 15 years living on book sale royalties and the problem of piracy.</p>



<p>I couldn&#8217;t agree more with the comments Pilgrim quotes. So few people have an inherent desire to pirate and it&#8217;s an accessible option to even less. iTunes &#8220;beat&#8221; piracy by being better. iTunes is easier, faster and more reliable, it&#8217;s simply a more desirable option even to those with the technical acumen to pirate content. With the &#8220;bonus&#8221; of being the ethical option.</p>



<p>As commenter Peter <a href="http://www.davidflanagan.com/2011/04/javascript-the-1.html#comment-2020">points out</a>:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>I have been an OReilly Safari subscriber for several years. I can recommend this to every developer out there. … Yet, must admit it still pains me that for ~$500/year we as honest subscribers can not get the same convenience (offline access, unencumbered PDF’s) as people who just download a pirated PDF library for free.</p>

<p>Piracy doesn&#8217;t &#8220;win&#8221; for books because it&#8217;s free but because it&#8217;s better.</p>
