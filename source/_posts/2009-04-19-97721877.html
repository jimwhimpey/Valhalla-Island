<p>I am totally for maternity leave.</p>



<p>I am totally against <em>paid</em> maternity leave.</p>



<p>Consider this scenario: My Mum&#8217;s small business has one full time employee and no one else. If her employee got pregnant and took 6 months maternity leave while Mum had to, by law, pay her full (or even half) wage, the business would literally go bankrupt.</p>



<p>The other option is government funded paid maternity leave. It wouldn&#8217;t send small business bankrupt but it means the tax payer foots the bill for a working woman&#8217;s decision to get pregnant.</p>



<p>Besides that, why should anyone be paid while not doing anything? Accrued leave is different, you&#8217;ve worked to earn it.</p>



<p>That said, I couldn&#8217;t be more for unpaid maternity leave. I definitely think mothers need time to spend with their new born babies and they should take as much as they like with the promise of their job waiting for them when they&#8217;re ready to return.</p>
