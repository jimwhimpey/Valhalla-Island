<a href="http://slateinbrief.tumblr.com/">Slate in Brief </a><br/><p>When I read <a href="http://www.slate.com/">Slate</a> I like it but I find the signal to noise ratio is low and the articles are a little long winded when it comes to the stuff I&#8217;m interested in. Enter Slate in Brief who distil many Slate articles down to a concise sentence or two making it easy to decide if you want to read more.</p>
