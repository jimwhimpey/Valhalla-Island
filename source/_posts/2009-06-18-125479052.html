<p><a href="http://www.thepunch.com.au/articles/Twitter-is-great-so-whats-the-next-big-thing">Yeah, Twitter’s great. But what’s the next big thing?</a></p><p>At work we <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/events/state-of-origin-09/">use Twitter</a> to supplement what we do traditionally (as far as the internet goes) and it works great. We&#8217;re always looking for <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/events/iran-social-media/">new ways</a> to use it and everyone loves it but <em>still</em>, like this article, my colleagues are obsessed with the next Twitter.</p>



<p>Fuck the next Twitter. Twitter <em>is</em> great and we have it <em>now</em>. Forget about what doesn&#8217;t exist yet and focus on making best use of what&#8217;s at our present disposal. Meanwhile be open to new things, don&#8217;t ignore anything because it isn&#8217;t popular yet but treat it on its merits. The only difference between Twitter now and Twitter three years ago is the amount of people writing it off as useless.</p>
