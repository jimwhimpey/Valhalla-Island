<blockquote>But while Apple may be acting spitefully, they’re not spiting themselves. The iPhone’s lack of Flash has not hurt it one bit.</blockquote>&#8212;<p>John Gruber in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2010/01/apple_adobe_flash">Apple, Adobe and Flash</a>. This is what the entire Flash on the iPhone &#8220;debate&#8221; boils down to, those in the Flash camp say the iPhone <em>has</em> to support Flash, why? iPhones have been selling like hotcakes for two and a half years. Even if there&#8217;s people not buying the iPhone because of its lack of Flash (which I don&#8217;t believe there is) who cares? <strong><em>They&#8217;re selling millions of them</em></strong>.</p>



<p>Sidenote: Great to read a Gruber piece about the Mac and computers, even if shared with the iPhone.</p>
