<a href="http://bergcloud.com/littleprinter/"><img src="/assets/tumblr/tumblr_lvivk7MxPc1qzwfbio1_500.png"/></a><br/><p>Will <a href="http://bergcloud.com/littleprinter/">Little Printer</a> actually pre-print a face on every print out you make? That&#8217;d be kind of annoying. Also, I can&#8217;t imagine anyone having the desire to read news headlines or Foursquare updates on a piece of receipt paper. This solves no problems but look how <em>cute</em> it is.</p>
