<p>Every Mac blog I used to follow for their insightful computer and software analysis and opinion has now diverted almost their entire attention to, in this order, mobile phones in general, App Store criticism, AT&amp;T, Verizon and the iPhone.</p>



<p>It sucks.</p>



<p>I like my iPhone and it&#8217;s certainly a useful, informative and enjoyable upgrade from my old phone. I believe it&#8217;s the best mobile phone available by a long shot. That&#8217;s where my interest in all mobile phones and mobile phone infrastructure ends. My carrier in Australia, Optus, isn&#8217;t fantastic and I barely care about <em>that</em>, let alone what sounds like an equally not perfect carrier in AT&amp;T, <em>let alone the rival to AT&amp;T</em>.</p>



<p>As for the App Store, the apps I use regularly, Instapaper, Tumblr and Tweetie were available for me to purchase in the store and I enjoy them. Updates take a while to come through the system and as a consumer, the one forking out money, I don&#8217;t care. My iPhone is a secondary device, if I lost my phone for a week it wouldn&#8217;t be a huge deal, I can wait a while for a bug to be fixed in an application I use 1 hour total per week while I sit on the train.</p>



<p>I used to pore over every word written at <a href="http://daringfireball.net/">Daring Fireball</a> but now I find myself completely skipping the majority of posts.</p>



<p>The obsession has moved so far beyond the iPhone and into everything however remotely connected to it. An app is forced to have a 17+ rating, HTC releases a new phone, Verizon run an ad campaign, Google releases a phone, HTC releases another phone. As far as I&#8217;m concerned it&#8217;s the equivalent of writing in depth about every shitty new laptop Dell releases. I&#8217;m sad to have lost some of my favourite writing to a topic I care so little about.</p>
