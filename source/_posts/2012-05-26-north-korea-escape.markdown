I recently read Orwell's 1984 for the first time. It was closely followed by this article about a young man born into a North Korean prison camp who is one of the few who have ever escaped. The similarities between Oceania and the prison camp blew me away. The forced labour, the extreme scarcity of resources, the culture of whistle blowing, the sexual repression and the torture were all the same.

As other dictatorships have fallen in recent times I look forward to the day the same happens in North Korea.
