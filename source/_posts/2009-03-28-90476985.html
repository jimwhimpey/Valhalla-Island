<blockquote>

  <p>Odd new Microsoft commercial, which purports to show a real person named Lauren trying to find a new 17-inch laptop for under $1000. She goes into “the Mac store” and comes out disappointed, because — and this is true — the only sub-$1000 laptop comes with a 13-inch display. But then she says, “I’m just not cool enough to be a Mac person.” One can only assume that it’s intended as an anti-elitist insult, but the bottom line is that Microsoft is explicitly reinforcing the idea that Macs are cool, which strikes me as a very odd tactic. The theme of the commercial seems to be “PCs: Computers for Losers”.</p>

<p>So Lauren comes out of the Apple store, can&#8217;t get what she wants under her budget then concludes that her problem is that she&#8217;s not cool enough?</p>



<p>Analogy: I have $2, I want a burger with two meat patties, lettuce and tomato. I go to McDonalds, the burger I want, a Big Mac, is $4, double my budget so instead I get a cheeseburger and conclude that I&#8217;m just not cool enough to eat a Big Mac.</p>
