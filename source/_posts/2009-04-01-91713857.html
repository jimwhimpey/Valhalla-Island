<p>A great deal of fawning over notebooks and pens happens on the internet. Curiously it happens most with people more than competent with a computer. Gus Mueller, software developer, <a href="http://gusmueller.com/blog/archives/2009/03/developer_notebooks.html">on notebooks</a>:</p>

  <p>I learned a long time ago that the two best debugging tools I own are a nice piece of paper, and a good pencil.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know whether Gus means this literally but if you&#8217;ve been in an exam that required writing code to answer questions you&#8217;ll know a flattened tree is pretty fucking useless when it comes to debugging. No doubt it&#8217;s great for working through easily visualised problems like trigonometry but the <em>best</em> debugging tool? I disagree.</p>



<p>Like <a href="http://mrgan.tumblr.com/post/91484728/man-without-a-notebook">Neven</a> I don&#8217;t <em>get</em> notebooks. Despite all the UIs I&#8217;ve created, programming problems I&#8217;ve solved and hundreds of words I write a day, I manage without a notebook, it&#8217;s possible.</p>



<p>They&#8217;re impractical, laborious to fill out, the contents completely inflexible once recorded, they&#8217;re impossible to organise, aren&#8217;t searchable, sharable or able to be backed up.</p>



<p>I think it&#8217;s a romantic idea â€” a rugged intellectual in a world where no one reads let alone writes. In lives dominated by computers people like to think the raw materials of a notebook and pen are still the best way, as far as I&#8217;m concerned, it&#8217;s not.</p>
