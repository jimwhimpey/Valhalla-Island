You may remember Bret Victor from his excellent [presentation on radically transparent "live" programming IDEs](http://vimeo.com/36579366) at CUSEC 2012.

Learnable Programming is half follow-up to that presentation and half response to teachers misinterpreting its message. It's an enlightening read interspersed with short videos which perfectly illustrate his point.

Bret's focus is on teaching programming but eliminating the opacity in programming environments and languages would be hugely beneficial to the most experienced software developer.

In the section on showing the state I didn't immediately understand the Processing's matrix scale and rotation states. Three seconds into the video demonstration of Bret's ideal programming environment and exactly what was happening couldn't have been more clear. It makes me rethink everything I know about writing code.
