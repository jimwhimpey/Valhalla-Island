I was handed the old University of Queensland Cycling Club website not long after it was launched. It was [Joomla](http://www.joomla.org/) hell. Not only was it extremely difficult to do regular administrative stuff like *create pages* but it was very buggy and the back end was more opaque than the front. This put me in a situation where I was responsible for running the site but *hated* using it and couldn't even take steps towards fixing it or adding anything new.

So I spent months recreating the whole site in WordPress and [bbPress](http://bbpress.org/) with a custom theme and a few custom plugins. I'm really happy with how it turned as far as design and functionality goes but most importantly it frees my club from the clutches of Joomla.
