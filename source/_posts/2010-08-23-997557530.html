<a href="http://www.ahousebythepark.com/journal/">A House by the Park</a><br/><p>I&#8217;m too young to be so excited by something like this but (thanks to <a href="http://a.wholelottanothing.org/">Matt</a>) I&#8217;ve only just come across Mike Davidson&#8217;s blog documenting his process of building an amazing house from start to finish. Every detail is covered down to appliance choices including piece by piece costing breakdowns for the entire thing.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s nothing better than finding a great <em>mature</em> blog. It&#8217;s like waiting until a good TV show comes out on DVD. I can&#8217;t wait to read through the whole tale from the beginning.</p>
