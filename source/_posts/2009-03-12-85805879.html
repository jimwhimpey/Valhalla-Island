<blockquote>

  <p>But I’m not the target buyer for this device. If you walk along any city street, ride a subway or bus, or wander through the local gym, you’ll see that nearly everyone uses the stock Apple earbuds. It’s not that their ears are any more ideal for these things than mine, it’s just that most people don’t care or know any better. <em>This is what I got, this is what I’ll use.</em></p>

<p>I don&#8217;t see the current requirement for the bundled Apple headphones as an issue. Even I use the white earphones with my iPod Shuffle, a guy who uses $300 Sennheisers played through a headphone amplifier at home. Carrying anything bigger or more expensive than the stock headphones with a Shuffle defeats the purpose of the inexpensive and small Shuffle.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re willing to carry around a giant pair of headphones and spend $300+ on them, you&#8217;re willing to carry around a bigger, more expensive iPod, the Shuffle is not for you.</p>
