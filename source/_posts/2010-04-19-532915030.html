<p>Years ago I read about the elegance and simplicity of Ruby on Rails and couldn&#8217;t wait to try it out but each of the few times I tried to dive in the following year I was overwhelmed by convention I didn&#8217;t understand and abandoned the idea.</p>



<p>When recently in Sydney I told <a href="http://toolmantim.com/">toolmantim</a> about my failed attempts using Rails and he told me about <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a>, the lightweight Ruby web framework which sounded like what I had originally hoped Rails would be.</p>



<p>Just two weeks ago I started <a href="http://darkroom.heroku.com/">Darkroom</a> in my spare time with no experience writing Ruby. Today it&#8217;s basically complete: a big Flickr slideshow presentation!</p>



<p>See it in action with <a href="http://darkroom.heroku.com/photos/Wolfgang+Bartelme/sets/72157622707212478">this gorgeous set of nature photos</a> by Wolfgang Bartelme or <a href="http://darkroom.heroku.com/photos/Jorge+Quinteros">Jorge Quinteros&#8217;s photostream</a>.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s even a bookmarklet for redirecting Flickr URLs to Darkroom URLs!</p>



<p>The idea was born from my frustration with Flickr&#8217;s 500px wide default with no way to navigate between photos and anything larger outside the Flash slideshow. <a href="http://ihardlyknowher.com/">I Hardly Know Her</a> tackled the same issue but falls short, defaulting to a smaller size and not offering titles or descriptions.</p>



<p>Sinatra has built in support for <a href="http://haml-lang.com/">HAML</a> and <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a> two more tools I&#8217;ve wanted to try for a while. They&#8217;re both a joy. Writing vanilla HTML and CSS feels like running in soft sand. I&#8217;m planning to convert almost every web property I have to Sinatra if only for the effortless HAML and SASS support.</p>



<p>The last piece of the puzzle is deployment with <a href="http://heroku.com/">Heroku</a>, a process which is nothing short of magic. From start to finish the combination of Sinatra, HAML, SASS and Heroku is the kind of elegance and simplicity that I&#8217;d always hoped Ruby on Rails was.</p>
