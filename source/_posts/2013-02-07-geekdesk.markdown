Not being one for in depth research I went to The Wirecutter's [standing desk recommendations](http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-standing-desks/). Everything they reviewed and recommended were far too small for my taste. [The GeekDesk](http://www.geekdesk.com/) came in multiple large sizes and looked great. [I bought it](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jimwhimpey/8455166686/in/photostream).

I've been using it for over a month now and love it.

As expected standing is great for about 30-45 minutes after which I'm happy to be able to drop it back down to sitting.

I like it so much I switched to a standing desk at work. Work's standing desks aren't dynamically adjustable. They're set to a specific height perfect for standing and come with a high stool. They're good too but the GeekDesk's ability to switch between a normal seated position and standing is far superior.

An unexpected but huge benefit of the GeekDesk's fine grained height control is that this is the first time ever I've had a desk at the perfect height in the *seated* position. Even if I never stood it would be worth it for that alone.

It was easy to put together, feels very sturdy, is finished nicely and the height presets make it simple to operate. Without the height presets it'd be frustrating to operate. Switching between sitting and standing takes one button press and around 10 seconds.

Highly recommended.
