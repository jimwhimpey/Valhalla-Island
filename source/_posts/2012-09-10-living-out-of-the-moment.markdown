Reddit user CheesyGoodness [went to a Jason Mraz concert](http://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/yfosy/i_hadnt_been_to_a_concert_in_10_years_and_thought/):

> We got 3rd row center seats to his show last night. Throughout the whole show just about everyone around us was holding up their cameras, ipads, whatever for the entire fucking show.

Everyone knows [how I feel](http://valhallaisland.com/blog/2012/tune-in-turn-off-plug-out/) about [this kind of behaviour](http://valhallaisland.com/blog/2012/being-present/) but it *really* bothers me so I'm going to go on about it forever.

Using a camera like this is the epitome of not living in the moment. It's sacrificing the present so that your future self will be able to reminisce about your past self.
