<blockquote>This update adds “Sidekick”, a feature for exporting data in a format which you can use with mobile devices [&#8230;]</blockquote>&#8212;<p>From the latest <a href="http://barebones.com/products/yojimbo/">YoJimbo</a> release notes, one of my long time favourite OS X applications. The difficulty in getting YoJimbo content onto an iPhone (and impossibility without thinking of it in advance) has been my almost only frustration. Short of syncing with MobileMe to a companion iPhone application this new Sidekick feature is it.</p>



<p>Calling it an export is an understatement. While Sidekick is running (which can be all the time) it maintains an iPhone-friendly, standalone HTML output of all your YoJimbo content under a directory you specify. I&#8217;ve got it exporting to a mounted disk of a password protected web server I can access anywhere.</p>



<p>This leaves one remaining issue with now otherwise perfect software: the lack of a NetNewsWire-like three column view. Thankfully this is easily solved manually with <a href="http://hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/widescreen-hack-for-yojimbo-2">Jon Hicks flawless widescreen hack</a>.</p>
