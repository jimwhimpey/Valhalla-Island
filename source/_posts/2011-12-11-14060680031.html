<blockquote>Whether to expand recurring events into instances and only return single one-off events and instances of recurring events, but not the underlying recurring events themselves.</blockquote>&#8212;Google&#8217;s developer documentation drives me insane. This is a verbatim quote from their <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/explorer/#_s=calendar&amp;_v=v3&amp;_m=events.list">API explorer</a> describing an option for calendar outputs. For a company which maintains so many public APIs and is apparently full of smart people they&#8217;re terrible at documentation.
