I live in it now. I wasn't looking to leave Australia or even the ABC but when the offer came from [Flickr](http://flickr.com) I couldn't refuse.

It came while I was [on holiday in France](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jimwhimpey/sets/72157630365880760/) which added something extra to my [already surreal experiences there](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jimwhimpey/7598278198/in/set-72157630365880760). I love Brisbane, I love Australia and there's few American cities I'd leave for but San Francisco is one of them.

Getting into and working in the United States isn't easy and it was a long process. I used the lead up to exhaust my leave, sell almost every possession and spend a lot of time with friends and family.

Selling or giving away all my stuff wasn't the liberating experience I thought it might be. At the time and now that I'm settling here I've realised again that [I'm not a minimalist](http://localhost:4000/blog/2009/160357037).

The process hasn't daunted me at all which I credit to barely missing a day cycling. Bike commuting, racing and general riding is huge in San Francisco and the best places to do it are beautiful and accessible. The cycling scene is very different to that in Brisbane and my urge is to recreate what I had back home but I'm fighting that ill-advised goal.

By sheer coincidence I met [Mike Fowler](http://mikefowler.me/), a fellow vegan, bike rider, front end web developer and recent addition to the city bizarrely working at [Findery](https://findery.com/), Caterina Fake's new company. We found a place together in a great spot we'll stay in for six months before finding something more permanent.

A month in and I love San Francisco. The general vibe is liberal, friendly and relaxed. A friend described it as a playground for adults and now that I think about it, I've seen an absurdly low number of children since being here. San Franciscans love complaining about the weather but as far as I'm concerned it's ideal. There are delicious cheap (and often vegan) places to eat *everywhere*. The riding in Marin County just North of the city is [gorgeous](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jimwhimpey/8185451512/in/photostream). I'm trying every cafe, bar, food co-op, park and bike shop, quickly finding favourites.

I'm enjoying all the perks of being in this city and this country: [Uber](https://www.uber.com/), [Zipcar](http://www.zipcar.com/), [Netflix](https://signup.netflix.com/), [Amazon Prime](http://www.amazon.com/gp/prime), oh man, Amazon Prime has changed my life. Almost everyone  knowing exactly what a "web developer" does is nice too.

And as for work, it's even better than I'd hoped. I've been a paying Flickr user for over six years and I'm excited about being part of its future. It's chock full of very smart cool people and with Marissa Meyer at Yahoo's helm there's a lot of positivity in the office.

2012 will be quite a year for the [concise history](/history).
