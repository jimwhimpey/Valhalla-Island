<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/guidedtour/">iPhone 3G S Guided Tour Video</a></p><p>Samsung and other mobile phone manufacturers sell their phones using <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQCLS0yej4g">visual gimmicks</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgfCEDdCw9A">celebrities</a> and treat <em>actually using the phone</em> as beside the point. It&#8217;s a testament to the iPhone that its marketing video doubles as an <em>instructional</em> video. The same goes for the huge majority of <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/gallery/ads/">iPhone TV spots</a>, showing how it works sells the device, imagine that!</p>



<p>Make a great product and the marketing takes care of itself.</p>
