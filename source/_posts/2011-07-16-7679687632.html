<a href="http://37signals.com/founderstories/slicehost">The Slicehost Story</a><br/><p>For someone who&#8217;s bored to death by most kinds of business or start up talk, I was riveted by this story about a couple of guys who did it right then struggled with the moral dilemma of getting big. Well produced and presented.</p>
