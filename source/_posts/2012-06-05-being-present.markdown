As part of our Diamond Jubilee coverage ABC News posted this photo of the crowd "welcoming" the Queen at the Epsom Derby:

<a href='http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-06-03/racegoers-photograph-queen27s-arrival/4049408'><img src='http://static.jimwhimpey.com/blog/1338969561-small.jpeg' alt='1338969561' /></a>

The people in this photo are at most, foregoing and at least, diminishing a *real live experience* so they can instead take a personal recording of the scene in front of them.

This is insane to me. Be present in the moment, either [remember or not](http://www.bigcontrarian.com/2010/07/06/pictures/) and live your damn life. Not everything needs to be seen through a 3.5" LCD screen held in your hand.
