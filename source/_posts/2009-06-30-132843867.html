<p>I was very late to the Instapaper scene. I&#8217;m notoriously good at ignoring things that don&#8217;t immediately please me visually (while taking too much notice of stuff that does) which may have extended the delay, Instapaper is no doubt ugly on the web.</p>



<p>A few weeks ago I stopped ignoring it, installed the bookmarklet and saved a few articles mainly from the fantastic <a href="http://givemesomethingtoread.com/">Give Me Something to Read</a>. A week later the <a href="http://blog.instapaper.com/post/127689346">iPhone app went on sale for half price</a>. Obviously a sign, I bought the app and have since replaced my current novel with what is the best way to read anything online.</p>



<p>Instapaper strips out advertising, images and other bullshit. You&#8217;re left with perfectly legible text formatted how you&#8217;d like (17px Georgia on a dark background). Tilt to scroll and turn off rotation to read while lying on your side, an option I wish every rotating app provided.</p>



<p>With the Kindle not available in Australia I&#8217;ve wanted to use my iPhone as a reading device but hadn&#8217;t found a satisfactory experience. Navigation has been the obstacle, flicking or dragging is too labour-intensive to read anything of substance on a screen that can&#8217;t fit all that much text. Instapaper solves the problem with tilt scrolling and the experience is flawless. I&#8217;m using my iPhone more, reading more, learning more and enjoying it.</p>
