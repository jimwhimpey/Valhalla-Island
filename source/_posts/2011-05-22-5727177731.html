title: "The Truly Silent Phone"
---

<p>I don&#8217;t like the concept of phones. It shouldn&#8217;t be socially acceptable to interrupt anyone at any time with a demand for their complete attention. That said, situations exist where information is important enough to warrant interruption.</p>



<p>To partly deal with it I rarely had my phone set to anything but silent. In reality &#8220;silent&#8221; mode with vibration on is actually quite loud and jarring, much more jarring than many ringtones and especially if your phone is sitting on a hard surface. Even in a pocket I find the vibration more of a shock than a vibration-less ringtone.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s only recently that I identified anxiety attached my ringing and vibrating phone and the attention it demanded. So I decided that as well as permanent silent mode I&#8217;d turn off vibrate and I haven&#8217;t looked back, it&#8217;s a joy.</p>



<p>If my phone is in view the most notification I get of a call or text is a lit up screen. Much less distracting and more easily ignored than a loud ring or vibrate. If it&#8217;s not in view I get <em>no notification at all</em>. Even when in view I get zero notification of new email, an added bonus.</p>



<p>Sure I miss a lot of calls but in a couple of months it&#8217;s never mattered, people leave a message and can wait until I next check my phone and I&#8217;m free to call. If I&#8217;m expecting a call and my phone isn&#8217;t within peripheral vision I&#8217;ll temporarily turn off silent mode.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a simple change and it may sound dramatic but it feels liberating.</p>
