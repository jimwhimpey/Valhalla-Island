<blockquote>When people find it necessary to inform their friends about how unbearably arid and stultifying their lives are &#8212; which they do at a rate of roughly 2,000 status updates an hour &#8212; the word they choose most often is &#8220;boring.</blockquote><p>Gene Weingarten <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/17/AR2010091704716.html?hpid=topnews">spends a little time with Openbook</a> and quantifies  something I see first hand every day from my own Facebook friends.</p>



<p>The thought of being bored boggles my mind. I&#8217;m constantly dismissing practical things I&#8217;d love to do because time is limited. I&#8217;m constantly evaluating the things I do spend my time on questioning whether it&#8217;s really what I want to be doing more than all those things I don&#8217;t do. We live in an world where amazing things are always at our fingertips. I couldn&#8217;t imagine being bored if I lived to 250 years.
