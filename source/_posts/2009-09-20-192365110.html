<p>A week ago I cleaned my wireless Apple keyboard as I had many times before. This time it left my p,&#160;; and / keys nonfunctional, rendering the whole keyboard useless. This comes at a time I was thinking about replacing my regular Apple keyboard at work with the wireless equivalent.</p>



<p>The decision to get the wireless keyboard in the first place was hard enough â€” $109 to replace something perfectly functioning, only wireless is ridiculously decadent. Yet having to use the wired version is driving me insane. I realise these are irrational feelings, there&#8217;s no practical reason I need a wireless keyboard at all let alone in exchange for $109.</p>
