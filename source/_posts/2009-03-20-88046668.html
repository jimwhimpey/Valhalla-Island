<blockquote>When&#8217;s the last time a major browser vendor shipped a major update that debuted in last place for performance and compliance? (IE7, I guess)</blockquote><a href="https://twitter.com/gruber/status/1356933023">John Gruber</a>. Surely Microsoft are ashamed of Internet Explorer. It&#8217;s getting whipped by browsers with 1/100th of Microsoft&#8217;s resources. It&#8217;s not getting beaten the way OS X beats Windows either, browser performance can be measured by real, tangible tests and IE8&#160;<a href="http://cybernetnews.com/2008/03/26/cybernotes-browser-performance-comparisons/">comes last every time</a>. It&#8217;s got to be embarrassing when the only people who use your software are either forced or ignorant.
