Calendars present whole calendar months because they don&#8217;t know what day it is, your computer does and it should take advantage of that knowledge.</p>



<p>In this case it&#8217;s the middle of the month and I want to see what&#8217;s happening early next next month <em>in the context of today</em>. Hit the arrow button and you&#8217;re in the next month without context. It&#8217;s impossible to see four weeks ahead of the current day in the same view yet I&#8217;m being shown two weeks of events in the past which I no longer care about at all.</p>



<p>I think I&#8217;ve been frustrated by and blogged about this at least four times over the past five years. Surely someone has fixed this problem?</p>
