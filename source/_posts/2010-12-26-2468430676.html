<p><a href="http://www.sleepycity.net/posts/252/Demolition_of_the_Paris_Metro">Photos Inside the Paris Metro</a></p><p>Incredible photos taken by a bunch of testosterone-fuelled adrenaline junkies sneaking into the Metro, Paris&#8217;s 100-year-old underground railway service. This stuff fascinates the hell out of me and it&#8217;s worth reading through the bravado to get an idea of what it&#8217;s really like down there. I can&#8217;t believe there&#8217;s stations that were built down there but never connected to the surface.</p>



<p>The foresight to build such a system so long ago is what makes a city like Paris great and why a city like Brisbane will never be on par.</p>
