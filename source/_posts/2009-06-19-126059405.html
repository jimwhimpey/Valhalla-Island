The top grab is from the refurb store, the bottom from the standard store both taken today. The previous version of an almost identically specced Macbook Pro is selling second hand (albeit refurbed) for $600&#160;<em>more</em> than a brand new one and that&#8217;s <em>with a $500 discount</em>! The latest model also sports a much better battery and an SD card slot.</p>



<p>Macbook Pros have gone from incredibly overpriced to very reasonably priced since WWDC. I have a feeling Apple will have a tough time moving that computer from the refurb store.</p>
