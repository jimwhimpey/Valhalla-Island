<p><a href="http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/print/2007/11/memory/foer-text">Remember This</a></p><p>For 15 years EP has lived in a perpetual two minute loop of memory:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>I want to take him by the arm and shake him. &#8220;You have a rare and debilitating memory disorder,&#8221; I want to tell him. &#8220;The last 50 years have been lost to you. In less than a minute, you&#8217;re going to forget that this conversation ever even happened.&#8221; I imagine the sheer horror that would befall him, the momentary clarity, the gaping emptiness that would open up in front of him, and close just as quickly. And then the passing car or the singing bird that would snap him back into his oblivious bubble.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>He&#8217;s happy and completely free of worry or anxiety. He&#8217;s not frustrated by his debilitation because he forgets that he forgets.</p>



<p>On the other hand AJ remembers <em>everything</em>:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>I don&#8217;t forgive myself for a lot of things. Your memory is the way it is to protect you. I feel like it just hasn&#8217;t protected me. I would love just for five minutes to be a simple person and not have all this stuff in my head. &#8220;Most people have called what I have a gift,&#8221; AJ says, &#8220;but I call it a burden.&#8221;</p>

</blockquote>



<p>As someone who&#8217;s brain has completely erased the memory of a horrific car accident I am thankful for an appropriately forgetful mind but the opposite extreme, the memory of a goldfish, is equally frightening.</p>
