title: "The Tablet: Part II"
---

<p>As we get closer to the <em>keynote of truth</em> rumours are pointing to the Apple Tablet not as a competitor to notebooks, netbooks or existing tablet PCs but to the Kindle and other ebook readers. My <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/313985171">lack of enthusiasm</a> a week ago has been replaced by bated anticipation.</p>



<p>While I have no use for a tablet computer, I&#8217;ve been on the verge of a Kindle purchase for months, only a stack of unread paperbacks stand in my way. I think Apple can make a better Kindle and the idea of an iTunes store for books and magazine subscriptions sounds ideal.</p>
