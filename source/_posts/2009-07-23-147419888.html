<blockquote>Now, I have nothing against cars. Actually, I like cars. They can be useful and fun. Unfortunately, the problem is that many people who operate cars don&#8217;t realize they&#8217;re operating machines, and this is because cars have become so coddling that operating one requires only slightly more effort than watching the Tour de France on your sofa in a state of semi-consciousness while wearing a pair of adult diapers. Yes, the roads are full of bloated vehicles driven by people who need interior microclimates and crow&#8217;s nest vantage points and nine airbags and DVD players to distract their kids and 70-point monitoring systems to keep them awake. Meanwhile, some people think the answer is more efficient cars or alternative energy sources. I strongly disagree. The answer is legislation requiring that all cars have manual transmissions, no airbags, and carbeurated, air-cooled engines with no more than 1500cc displacement. That way, people would actually need to know how to drive, and they&#8217;d also have to pay attention to what they were doing.</blockquote>I couldn&#8217;t agree more with (most of) <a href="http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2009/07/simplify-less-is-less.html">Bike Snob&#8217;s stance on cars</a>.
