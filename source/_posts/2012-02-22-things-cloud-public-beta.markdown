[Things Cloud Public Beta](http://culturedcode.com/things/blog/2012/02/things-cloud-public-beta.html)

I've been a loyal Things user for years and I've been using the closed beta of Things on the Mac and iPhone for many months. From the day I downloaded the first beta it's been as solid as a rock. It was a long time coming but Cultured Code ignored the public pressure, took the time to do it right and it's paid off. The Things syncing experience is polished to a very high gloss.
