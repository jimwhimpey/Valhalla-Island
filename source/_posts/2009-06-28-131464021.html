<a href="http://joe.hewitt.usesthis.com/">The Setup: Joe Hewitt</a><br/><p>Firefox, Firebug and Facebook developer Joe Hewitt has my dream setup. An extremely powerful desktop running two massive screens in combination with a relatively low spec but small and portable laptop. Power and screen space where portability doesn&#8217;t matter and portability where power and screen space doesn&#8217;t matter. Perfectly complimentary.</p>



<p>I was running a junior version of this setup while at university. 24&#8221; iMac at home and 12&#8221; PowerBook out and about. It remains the best computer combination I&#8217;ve used. Now I&#8217;m in an awkward situation with a not-small laptop that&#8217;s more powerful than my desktop, I don&#8217;t like it but my requirements are unusual and my options are limited.</p>
