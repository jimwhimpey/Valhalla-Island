<a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/07/06/2945557.htm">Extreme Mollycoddling</a><br/><p>An English couple are <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/07/06/2945557.htm">under fire for letting kids cycle to school</a>. It&#8217;s a 1500m route along footpaths that the parents have taught their children. The most &#8220;dangerous&#8221; part involves crossing one road manned by a lollipop lady.</p>



<p>Needless to say, this is madness. I started cycling to school from grade 2 and I still remember the liberation I felt being able to ride to school and friend&#8217;s houses. There was a huge bike lockup at my primary school which was always filled to the brim with bikes.</p>



<p>Ironically, it&#8217;s the convoy of automobiles carrying one child each and the infrastructure to support it at the expense of safer bike and pedestrian facilities that make such independence at all dangerous to begin with. No primary school kid wearing a helmet is going to die in even a bike on bike accident. I fell off my bike more times than I can remember riding to and from school, a little road rash does nothing but teach kids how to deal with crises, albeit small ones, independently.</p>



<p>It seems that even in the 12 years since I was in primary school such freedom has been eradicated. I&#8217;d be very interested to go back to my primary school to see how full the bike rack is now.</p>
