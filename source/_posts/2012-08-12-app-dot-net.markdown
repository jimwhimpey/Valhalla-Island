Me, [four months ago](https://twitter.com/jimwhimpey/status/218849763532087296):

> Build Twitter as it existed years ago, mimic the APIs simply with a different host and I think you'd have great success.

That's [App.net](https://join.app.net/). The opaquely named and described ("real-time social feed") service that'll be a Twitter alternative, [mimicing the API](https://github.com/appdotnet/api-spec/blob/master/objects.md) and asking for money from users instead of advertisers.

I love Twitter but it's been moving in [an uncomfortable direction](https://dev.twitter.com/blog/delivering-consistent-twitter-experience) contrary to my desired use of the service (i.e. never via the website or official clients) for a while. 

App.net's ideology matches mine: 

> We believe that advertising-supported social services are so consistently and inextricably at odds with the interests of users and developers that something must be done.

I'm glad they're taking it on but I have two concerns.<p></p>

Firstly, why fund this using the Kickstarter model? It's a software project [already well underway](https://alpha.app.net/global/), I don't know why a huge capital base is required. They haven't taken a single dollar to this point and they'll be taking on paying customers once the services is live. Is the half million just to fund development between the alpha and launch? The Kickstarter-like fundraiser feels like a gimmicky cash grab to me. It's certainly been good for proving demand exists but there's a reason ongoing projects like these are against Kickstarter's terms of service.

As of this writing they're $40k away from the goal with 45 hours remaining. It looks like they'll reach the $500k but what if they fell, say, $5k short? Would they abandon an idea they've already partially implemented that there's obviously significant demand for? I doubt it.

Secondly, $50/year is *a lot*. I'm all for software financially supported by users but a social networks's value increases exponentially as the user base grows. $50 is a significant barrier to growth, especially when there's established and completely free competition. I think limited free plus premium paid accounts (Ã  la Flickr and Strava) makes more sense in this context. That said, I've pre-registered an account and I'll be happy to be proven wrong.
