**2013**: In San Francisco I meet Jess, the girl I will marry. I start the San Francisco Cycling Club. The best year yet.

**2012**: Rode my bike in the French Alps. Sold or gave away everything I owned and moved across the Pacific to work at Flickr in San Francisco. A big year.

**2011**: Fell head over heels in love with Anne. Moved into my own place. Rode and raced my bike a lot. Broke up with Anne. Wallowed in inner turmoil. I become vegan.

**2010**: Bike riding. Spending almost all I earn on inconsequential things. I break up with Kristin. I win some B grade bike races, start racing A grade.

**2009**: I get a great job as a web developer at the national broadcaster. I move out of home in the suburbs and into an inner-city suburb flat with Kristin. I become vegetarian. I get hit by a car while training on my bike, break 20 bones including multiple vertebrae. I recover.

**2008**: To make up for the time lost while in Canada and to finish my degree in 3 years I take a maximum course load. All my time is spent studying. University still fails to impress me. I meet and fall for Kristin. I graduate with above average but not spectacular grades. I take up triathlon and sell my car.

**2007**: Student exchange in Calgary, Canada. It's paid for by a scholarship.  I make a lot of amazing friends who remain friends years later. I love the game of hockey. Every day is a joy.

**2006**: I study internet computing at university. The first year is underwhelming.

**2005**: I get my first semi-serious girlfriend, we're together for a year before breaking up in flames. I graduate high school and get accepted into university.

**2004**: Half of my classes are computer related. Two of them are taught by a great teacher whose wife I end up working for during university and who I end up calling a friend.

**2003**: I get my first job at an auto products chain. It's not horrible, I earn some money, every cent of which I spend on fleeting pleasures.

**2002**: Mum relents, I move to the local high school, love school and love life again.

**2001**: Mum sent me to a private school 50 minutes by train from home. I didn't know anyone and hated it. The few friends I did make lived so far away I rarely saw them outside of school.

**1999–2000**: Grades 6 and 7. Started learning about computers and the internet from my computer obsessed grade 7 teacher.

**1998**: Around this time my parents separated and later divorced. Both parents move into units, I made a lot of friends at both places and had a great time. Not sad or emotionally scarred.

**1994–1997**: Grades 1-4 of primary school. It becomes clear I'm not a dunce but nor am I a child genius. I enjoy reading and take up playing soccer at the local club.

**1993**: Preschool. Making buildings out of blocks, looking after the preschool's rabbit.

**1992**: Kindergarten.

**1991**: Hanging out with my baby sister. Playing with our two dogs. Both of which are *shot* (with a gun) in our backyard. Both survive. One is killed by a car not long later. The other leads a long, healthy life.

**1990**: My sister is born.

**1988–1989**: Being a baby in our suburban home.

**1987**: Hello world. Born at the beginning of a Brisbane Summer.
