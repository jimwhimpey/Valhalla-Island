  <div class="entry-content"><p>The complete artistic freedom to create <em>whatever you want</em> as a music video must be one of the greatest perks that come with being a successful musical act. Most artists squander the opportunity on bland, abstract rubbish so full of jump cuts and general over-editing they&#8217;re difficult to watch.</p>



<p>OK Go take full advantage, producing beautifully crafted and entertaining clips based on original ideas. There&#8217;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJKythlXAIY">another video</a> for the same track which couldn&#8217;t be more different for content but is equally creative and well executed. Meanwhile they&#8217;re uploading everything they do in 1080p to YouTube. In an industry where so many don&#8217;t, OK Go <em>gets it</em>.</p>

	        <h2 class="entry-title">Quicken Essentials for Mac</h2>
	      
			
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since giving up on the frustratingly incomplete <a href="http://www.midnightapps.com/chaching/">Cha-Ching</a> months ago with no attractive alternative I have simply not been managing my money. Quicken was the last developer I expected to come to my rescue but after a few hours with <a href="http://quicken.intuit.com/">Quicken Essentials for Mac</a> I&#8217;m surprised to find it nails my personal requirements.</p>



<p>They are:</p>



<ul><li>Fast data entry. An entry can be made super quickly using only the keyboard. Vital for consistently completing what is a chore.</li>

<li>A 100% customisable categorisation system. You&#8217;re provided you with a default set but it can be replaced with your own. This was one of my biggest frustrations with Cha-Ching.</li>

<li>Representation of upcoming scheduled transactions in the regular transaction list. At a glance you can see not only how much you have <em>right now</em> but how much you&#8217;re expecting to have in the near future. Also a simple way to keep upcoming expenses on the radar. Better yet, the future buffer period is configurable.</li>

<li>The concept of reconciled transactions. My ideal workflow is adding transactions as I make them before reconciling a bunch of transactions with my bank statement once every week or so.</li>

<li>Online integration must be fantastic for those who want it but nothing integrates with my obscure building society and I don&#8217;t want it to anyway. If my financial situation ever becomes so complex I can&#8217;t feasibly enter each transaction and reconcile the account manually something else has to change. For those who don&#8217;t want it, online integration stays out of the way in Quicken Essentials.</li>

<li>Maximum use of native UI widgets. Other OS X finance applications try too hard to be cute at the expense of clarity and usability.</li>

</ul><p>As for downsides there&#8217;s an extremely sparse list of preferences. If Quicken wasn&#8217;t notorious for lack of software updates I&#8217;d suggest it&#8217;s no big deal for a first release.</p>



<p>The model of creating a user managed file to store data is used which usually bothers me a great deal for a library style app like Essentials. Although everything is done to make the model invisible to a user with the file automatically created in the Documents directory, no save function whatsoever and autoloading of the last open file which makes it a non-issue but I do wonder why they can&#8217;t just create the same file in ~/Library, out of sight.</p>



<p>They&#8217;ve obviously tried hard to go native with the UI but some quirks remain like these awkward dividers between accounts in the source list:</p>



<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_kyg2huZL9Y1qzw2y9.png" alt="Source List Dividers"/></p>



<p>Other categories in the source list don&#8217;t have them, they&#8217;re plain unnecessary. That said, kudos to Quicken for using a traditional source list at all. Then there&#8217;s the inline transaction creator which functions beautifully but just feels <em>weird</em>:</p>



<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_kyg2lbTDzy1qzw2y9.png" alt="Transaction Creator"/></p>



<p>If some small UI quirks are all I&#8217;ve got to complain about Quicken have done a great job,  it feels great to be managing my money again.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://staff.tumblr.com/post/394917564/auto-reblog-as-link">Automatically posting huge reblogs as links</a> is the most positive and useful feature Tumblr has implemented in a long time. Although 500 words isn&#8217;t a small enough limit. Duplicating content in full undermines the hyperlinks the internet is built on besides being plain <em>unethical</em>.</p>



<p>It comes after a string of strange feature additions like <a href="http://staff.tumblr.com/post/378956398/photo-replies">photo replies</a> and <a href="http://staff.tumblr.com/post/320191537/ask">ask a question</a> which seem to be pushing Tumblr in a different, social network like (cringe) direction.</p>



<p>Meanwhile the largest reliable width photo you can use in your themes is only 500 pixels wide. There&#8217;s <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/custom_themes#photo-posts">four other options</a>, all <em>smaller</em> than 500 pixel. There&#8217;s a high res option that could be any size at any aspect ratio and if your image is below a certain threshold nothing will show at all..</p>



<p>I can ask a user a question natively within Tumblr (isn&#8217;t email for this?)  but it&#8217;s impossible to reliably display photos larger than 500 pixels wide in my theme.</p>

<p><strong>Sidenote</strong>: Macworld&#8217;s video player is a great example of video done wrong. Flash based playlist, no permalinks, weird tab scroller UI, crap all round.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve experienced this first hand on two screenshots I posted to Flickr over three years ago. One of the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jimwhimpey/294080383/">Facebook login screen</a> and the equivalent at <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jimwhimpey/294080639/">MySpace</a>. I think at the time it was for a blog post comparing the two. They have remained the two most viewed images on my Flickr account over four years <em>by far</em>. Each have a number of comments like these:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>I love to talk and chat with people I do or do not know I am kind and hard working.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>and</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Hey ppl how is everyone doing me im fine im new here need to meet ppl.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>None of these people have any photos attached to their accounts, it appears they&#8217;ve got to that page, created a Flickr account and commented before (if ever) realising that this screenshot isn&#8217;t actually Facebook or Myspace. It&#8217;s mind blowing.</p>

	        <h2 class="entry-title">Prefabricated Housing</h2>
	      
			
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/271313749">think a lot</a> about the kind of place I want to live and recently I&#8217;ve been watching Trailer Park Boys (an unlikely great show). It occurred to me that the kind of demountable trailers you find in a trailer park closely fits my ideal.</p>



<p>The entire concept of a trailer park appeals to me: small cheap lots, small cheap homes, no fences, plenty of shared areas and community spirit. It&#8217;s a shame they&#8217;re almost exclusively limited to petty criminals living on the poverty line. I&#8217;d move into one today if I wasn&#8217;t sure my TV, computer and bike would be stolen within a week. I stereotype, but still.</p>



<p>Prefabricated housing is more substantial than a trailer and right at home outside of a trailer park. They offer everything I want:</p>



<ul><li>One or two bedrooms, all I need.</li>

<li>A small footprint that can be dropped on a relatively small (and therefore cheaper) block still leaving room for a backyard and shed.</li>

<li>Environmentally conscious design to make the best use of little energy or solely make use of natural energy.</li>

<li>A focus on large outdoor areas and openings.</li>

<li>and they&#8217;re cheap, less than $100,000 for one or two bedrooms.</li>

</ul><p>Find a small block close to the city for $150,000 or less, drop a prefab house on it for $100,000 and you&#8217;ve got yourself a brand new, standalone and <em>cheap</em> home with a backyard for a third of the price of a traditional house. I don&#8217;t know why they&#8217;re not more common.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Without having seen either screen I&#8217;m guessing the Kindle is much better for reading books. Better reading comfort and incredibly long battery life are the Kindle advantage.</p>



<p>Is that advantage plus the $230 you&#8217;ll save forfeiting an iPad purchase worth everything else the iPad offers including a book reader and Kindle app? If you don&#8217;t have an iPhone then I think the answer is no. If you do (who doesn&#8217;t), I think the answer is&#8230; how much do you read?</p>



<p>Is it realistic to own both? And an iPhone? I don&#8217;t think so.</p>



<p>It doesn&#8217;t look great for the Kindle. The thing that bothers me about the Kindle is that the $270 outlay gets you a device that&#8217;s pretty much useless until you spend more money at the same place, the only place you can buy books, Amazon.</p>



<p>Gruber <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2010/01/various_ipad_thoughts">writes</a>:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>I think Amazon is in the content business first, the device business second. A world where Kindle hardware sales pale in comparison to the iPad but where there’s a very popular Kindle app for iPad that competes against iBooks is not a bad situation for Amazon.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>I agree but what reason does anyone have to buy books from Amazon over Apple&#8217;s (presumably) better integrated, more convenient (if only slightly) system? The more Kindle&#8217;s in people&#8217;s hands the more reason to buy content from Amazon, for both devices.</p>



<p>Amazon should sell the Kindle <em>cheap</em>. Cost or below. Sell it on its merits: simply the best book reading experience. Make money on what they always have, books, which can be read across devices including the iPad. Amazon&#8217;s history and success is in selling books, sell more Kindles, sell more books. The more Kindles the more reason there is to buy from Amazon.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been through a roller coaster of feelings about the iPad.</p>



<ol><li>Weeks before the announcement I <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/313985171">couldn&#8217;t imagine</a> something to get excited about. The rumours pointed to a netbook competitor — yuck.</li>

<li>As hype reached fever pitch there was more talk of a Kindle competitor, an iPod for books if you will, <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/355849046"><em>that</em> interested me a great deal</a>.</li>

<li>The iPad was announced and it seemed to be exactly what I feared at first, a stupid netbook, something no one wants or needs in an area I thought Apple wouldn&#8217;t compete in. It seemed great for travel and not much else.</li>

<li>The more I read the further my eyes are opened to the potential of the iPad as a revolutionary device. And that&#8217;s where I stand now.</li>

</ol><p>Traditional netbooks, tablets, etc. suck because they&#8217;re the same old thing shoved into a different package. The Windows and Linux UIs are not made for a 10&#8221; screen, not made for touch interaction and no one likes miniature keyboards. Apple saw the opportunity for a device that does it <em>properly</em>.</p>



<p>My position as a relative computer expert initially skewed my views on exactly what the iPad is good for. I forget that the <em>huge majority</em> of computer users are little more than consumers in the literal sense. For them a computer is for getting information on the internet. The little more is a small, finite set of tasks: uploading photos, posting to a blog, Twitter or Facebook.</p>



<p>The modern computer — Windows, Mac OS, desktop Linux operating systems — offers a staggeringly large amount more than what the common user requires or wants. All that stuff is confusing and gets in the way of the tiny subset people actually want to do. Remember when Google asked people <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4MwTvtyrUQ&amp;feature=player_embedded">what is a web browser?</a> Filesystems, networking and even <em>double clicking</em> is less understood. Given our technological advances it&#8217;s ridiculous that personal computers are so difficult to use and understand for so many people.</p>



<p>The iPad changes that. Every non-professional computer user in my life could ditch their current computer for an iPad and not miss a thing. All those complicated concepts and configurations they don&#8217;t understand are abstracted away, hidden forever. Even most non-computing students who spend a great deal of time working on a computer could get by with an iPad, the entire iWork suite will be available in the app store.</p>



<p>It may be a significant size downgrade for many but when your only computing is recreational consuming, portability and flexibility trumps screen size. The trend has been towards laptops, even as desktops, for years now, the iPad is an extension.</p>



<p>I doubt its going to be an iPhone-equse instant success, I think it&#8217;ll take time for people to break the shackles of the current computing mindset and embrace a device that does less.</p>



<h3>Flash Bang</h3>



<p>The fallout from the iPad announcement is that like the iPhone, it doesn&#8217;t support Flash. <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2010/01/blue_boxes">Daring Fireball</a> has been doing a great job covering the opinion from both sides and in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/">his latest piece</a> makes a great point:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Used to be you could argue that Flash, whatever its merits, delivered content to the entire audience you cared about. That’s no longer true, and Adobe’s Flash penetration is shrinking with each iPhone OS device Apple sells.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Often web development is a series of compromises until you reach the lowest common denominator of features that are supported across the widest range of platforms. Flash used to be part of that lowest common denominator.</p>



<p>Our unofficial rule at work is that we stop actively supporting IE6 when usage drops below 1%. If users without Flash installed increases (and it&#8217;s only going to increase) to something like the <a href="http://smarterware.org/4978/flashs-decline-on-lifehacker-from-2006-to-2010">6% they&#8217;re seeing at Lifehacker</a> we can&#8217;t justify delivering <em>anything</em> solely in Flash. This is <em>great</em> news. For everyone but Adobe.</p>
