<p>I&#8217;ve experienced this first hand on two screenshots I posted to Flickr over three years ago. One of the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jimwhimpey/294080383/">Facebook login screen</a> and the equivalent at <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jimwhimpey/294080639/">MySpace</a>. I think at the time it was for a blog post comparing the two. They have remained the two most viewed images on my Flickr account over four years <em>by far</em>. Each have a number of comments like these:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>I love to talk and chat with people I do or do not know I am kind and hard working.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>and</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Hey ppl how is everyone doing me im fine im new here need to meet ppl.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>None of these people have any photos attached to their accounts, it appears they&#8217;ve got to that page, created a Flickr account and commented before (if ever) realising that this screenshot isn&#8217;t actually Facebook or Myspace. It&#8217;s mind blowing.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/271313749">think a lot</a> about the kind of place I want to live and recently I&#8217;ve been watching Trailer Park Boys (an unlikely great show). It occurred to me that the kind of demountable trailers you find in a trailer park closely fits my ideal.</p>



<p>The entire concept of a trailer park appeals to me: small cheap lots, small cheap homes, no fences, plenty of shared areas and community spirit. It&#8217;s a shame they&#8217;re almost exclusively limited to petty criminals living on the poverty line. I&#8217;d move into one today if I wasn&#8217;t sure my TV, computer and bike would be stolen within a week. I stereotype, but still.</p>



<p>Prefabricated housing is more substantial than a trailer and right at home outside of a trailer park. They offer everything I want:</p>



<ul><li>One or two bedrooms, all I need.</li>

<li>A small footprint that can be dropped on a relatively small (and therefore cheaper) block still leaving room for a backyard and shed.</li>

<li>Environmentally conscious design to make the best use of little energy or solely make use of natural energy.</li>

<li>A focus on large outdoor areas and openings.</li>

<li>and they&#8217;re cheap, less than $100,000 for one or two bedrooms.</li>

</ul><p>Find a small block close to the city for $150,000 or less, drop a prefab house on it for $100,000 and you&#8217;ve got yourself a brand new, standalone and <em>cheap</em> home with a backyard for a third of the price of a traditional house. I don&#8217;t know why they&#8217;re not more common.</p>

	        <h2 class="entry-title">The iPad and the Kindle</h2>
	      
			
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Without having seen either screen I&#8217;m guessing the Kindle is much better for reading books. Better reading comfort and incredibly long battery life are the Kindle advantage.</p>



<p>Is that advantage plus the $230 you&#8217;ll save forfeiting an iPad purchase worth everything else the iPad offers including a book reader and Kindle app? If you don&#8217;t have an iPhone then I think the answer is no. If you do (who doesn&#8217;t), I think the answer is&#8230; how much do you read?</p>



<p>Is it realistic to own both? And an iPhone? I don&#8217;t think so.</p>



<p>It doesn&#8217;t look great for the Kindle. The thing that bothers me about the Kindle is that the $270 outlay gets you a device that&#8217;s pretty much useless until you spend more money at the same place, the only place you can buy books, Amazon.</p>



<p>Gruber <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2010/01/various_ipad_thoughts">writes</a>:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>I think Amazon is in the content business first, the device business second. A world where Kindle hardware sales pale in comparison to the iPad but where there’s a very popular Kindle app for iPad that competes against iBooks is not a bad situation for Amazon.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>I agree but what reason does anyone have to buy books from Amazon over Apple&#8217;s (presumably) better integrated, more convenient (if only slightly) system? The more Kindle&#8217;s in people&#8217;s hands the more reason to buy content from Amazon, for both devices.</p>



<p>Amazon should sell the Kindle <em>cheap</em>. Cost or below. Sell it on its merits: simply the best book reading experience. Make money on what they always have, books, which can be read across devices including the iPad. Amazon&#8217;s history and success is in selling books, sell more Kindles, sell more books. The more Kindles the more reason there is to buy from Amazon.</p>

	        <h2 class="entry-title">The Tablet: Part III</h2>
	      
			
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been through a roller coaster of feelings about the iPad.</p>



<ol><li>Weeks before the announcement I <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/313985171">couldn&#8217;t imagine</a> something to get excited about. The rumours pointed to a netbook competitor — yuck.</li>

<li>As hype reached fever pitch there was more talk of a Kindle competitor, an iPod for books if you will, <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/355849046"><em>that</em> interested me a great deal</a>.</li>

<li>The iPad was announced and it seemed to be exactly what I feared at first, a stupid netbook, something no one wants or needs in an area I thought Apple wouldn&#8217;t compete in. It seemed great for travel and not much else.</li>

<li>The more I read the further my eyes are opened to the potential of the iPad as a revolutionary device. And that&#8217;s where I stand now.</li>

</ol><p>Traditional netbooks, tablets, etc. suck because they&#8217;re the same old thing shoved into a different package. The Windows and Linux UIs are not made for a 10&#8221; screen, not made for touch interaction and no one likes miniature keyboards. Apple saw the opportunity for a device that does it <em>properly</em>.</p>



<p>My position as a relative computer expert initially skewed my views on exactly what the iPad is good for. I forget that the <em>huge majority</em> of computer users are little more than consumers in the literal sense. For them a computer is for getting information on the internet. The little more is a small, finite set of tasks: uploading photos, posting to a blog, Twitter or Facebook.</p>



<p>The modern computer — Windows, Mac OS, desktop Linux operating systems — offers a staggeringly large amount more than what the common user requires or wants. All that stuff is confusing and gets in the way of the tiny subset people actually want to do. Remember when Google asked people <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4MwTvtyrUQ&amp;feature=player_embedded">what is a web browser?</a> Filesystems, networking and even <em>double clicking</em> is less understood. Given our technological advances it&#8217;s ridiculous that personal computers are so difficult to use and understand for so many people.</p>



<p>The iPad changes that. Every non-professional computer user in my life could ditch their current computer for an iPad and not miss a thing. All those complicated concepts and configurations they don&#8217;t understand are abstracted away, hidden forever. Even most non-computing students who spend a great deal of time working on a computer could get by with an iPad, the entire iWork suite will be available in the app store.</p>



<p>It may be a significant size downgrade for many but when your only computing is recreational consuming, portability and flexibility trumps screen size. The trend has been towards laptops, even as desktops, for years now, the iPad is an extension.</p>



<p>I doubt its going to be an iPhone-equse instant success, I think it&#8217;ll take time for people to break the shackles of the current computing mindset and embrace a device that does less.</p>



<h3>Flash Bang</h3>



<p>The fallout from the iPad announcement is that like the iPhone, it doesn&#8217;t support Flash. <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2010/01/blue_boxes">Daring Fireball</a> has been doing a great job covering the opinion from both sides and in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/">his latest piece</a> makes a great point:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Used to be you could argue that Flash, whatever its merits, delivered content to the entire audience you cared about. That’s no longer true, and Adobe’s Flash penetration is shrinking with each iPhone OS device Apple sells.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Often web development is a series of compromises until you reach the lowest common denominator of features that are supported across the widest range of platforms. Flash used to be part of that lowest common denominator.</p>



<p>Our unofficial rule at work is that we stop actively supporting IE6 when usage drops below 1%. If users without Flash installed increases (and it&#8217;s only going to increase) to something like the <a href="http://smarterware.org/4978/flashs-decline-on-lifehacker-from-2006-to-2010">6% they&#8217;re seeing at Lifehacker</a> we can&#8217;t justify delivering <em>anything</em> solely in Flash. This is <em>great</em> news. For everyone but Adobe.</p>

<p>While I have no use for a tablet computer, I&#8217;ve been on the verge of a Kindle purchase for months, only a stack of unread paperbacks stand in my way. I think Apple can make a better Kindle and the idea of an iTunes store for books and magazine subscriptions sounds ideal.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><img src="/assets/tumblr/tumblr_kwuqgpuai41qzwfbio1_500.jpg"/><br/><p>There is no limit to the hyperbole and plain <em>lies</em> that advertising will tell us. Ignoring the ridiculous &#8220;We live in your world&#8221; (which I bet sounded <em>great</em> to some ANZ executive in their marketing boardroom), <em>how</em> are ANZ making banking simpler? How can banking be any simpler? It&#8217;s a safe place to store your money, you gain modest interest on the account, you withdraw and pay for things from the account, you pay some fees for the convenience. <em>That&#8217;s it</em>. The explanation of banking as far as customers are concerned is not much longer than the billboard telling us how <em>simple</em> ANZ is making it.</p>



<p>For some reason this billboard reminds me of all those wireless broadband commercials that advertise a <strong>huge</strong> 2GB or a <strong>massive</strong> 500MB of data each month. How are they legally even able to describe it as that?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Along with blood pressure, smoker or non-smoker and cholesterol levels. This is completely insane. As suggested in the comments a much better idea would be to provide no discount at all on unhealthy products and a steeper discount on healthy food for <em>all employees</em>. There&#8217;s nothing to be gained by making unhealthy people pay more for good food, extremely unhealthy food (fast food, etc.) is already much cheaper.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote>But while Apple may be acting spitefully, they’re not spiting themselves. The iPhone’s lack of Flash has not hurt it one bit.</blockquote><p>John Gruber in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2010/01/apple_adobe_flash">Apple, Adobe and Flash</a>. This is what the entire Flash on the iPhone &#8220;debate&#8221; boils down to, those in the Flash camp say the iPhone <em>has</em> to support Flash, why? iPhones have been selling like hotcakes for two and a half years. Even if there&#8217;s people not buying the iPhone because of its lack of Flash (which I don&#8217;t believe there is) who cares? <strong><em>They&#8217;re selling millions of them</em></strong>.</p>



<p>Sidenote: Great to read a Gruber piece about the Mac and computers, even if shared with the iPhone.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The way I see it, meat is the epitome of processed foods. Thousands of litres of water, fertiliser and months producing grain and produce that&#8217;s processed into feed for animals. Thousands more of litres of water, tons of grain and produce fed to cattle over their entire lifespan. Years after the <em>process</em> began the meat is processed into little packages ready to be transported to your supermarket.</p>



<p>We can eat what cattle eat, why not cut out the middle <del>man</del> animal?</p>
