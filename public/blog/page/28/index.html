Use less materials, less electronics, strip it to its bare essentials and you have a car cheap to buy and cheap to run that even today is more practical and spacious than your modern sedan. It&#8217;s a shame they no longer make these, judging by the hugely inflated prices they go for second hand I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s a market for them.</p>

Without knowing the world is round how do you comprehend the sun rising and setting? The moon&#8217;s position in the sky? The stars? How do seasons happen? Why is it colder or hotter is some places to others? Why do time zones exist? What&#8217;s the horizon? Where <em>is</em> the earth in the grander scheme of things?</p>



<p>Ironically, while she&#8217;s completely ignorant of these real world <em>facts</em> that surround and affect her life, Shepherd wholeheartedly believes in God. Seems there&#8217;s a significant correlation between ignorance and religion.</p>

  <p>I love how Audi frames their brand as the rebel, the individual, the enemy of mediocrity and convention.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/jasonfried/statuses/1415408416">Jason Fried</a> before linking to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8MTpaBUCpc">this commercial for the Audi Q5</a>.</p>



<p>The way it&#8217;s been shot with fleeting split second images of the cars, the Audi black and the rest silver make it difficult to actually compare the cars. Here&#8217;s a side by side with the Audi Q5 and Lexus RX which from what I can tell is the other car featured in the commercial.</p>



<p><a href="http://static.jimwhimpey.com/images/audilexus-large.jpg"><img src="http://static.jimwhimpey.com/images/audilexus.jpg" alt="The Same"/></a></p>



<p>Sure, Audi markets themselves as a rebel, the enemy of convention but the truth is they&#8217;re making the same boring, almost identical cars as every other manufacturer.</p>

A beta of the next major version was released recently and with it, a companion iPhone application. Exciting stuff if you&#8217;re a long time Cha-Ching user hoping for more.</p>



<p>Despite the gaps and room for improvement in the first version, the most notable feature in the new beta is <strong>to dos</strong>. To dos barely belong in iCal. Incredibly, they were added to Mail and now <em>Cha-Ching</em>, a finance application, has integrated to do management. Think of any two, unrelated applications and integrate their functionality: instant messaging in Photoshop, web browsing into iTunes or feed reading into TextMate, that&#8217;s how much sense it makes. There&#8217;s already a slew of great, dedicated to do applications out there, the functionality already exists in two applications that ship with OS X (not that it should).</p>



<p>I emailed Midnight Apps with my thoughts. They argue that there&#8217;s tasks like paying bills that relate to finance so it makes sense to have to do management integrated with a finance application. The majority of my 900 completed tasks recorded in <a href="http://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a>, a dedicated to do application, are completed in TextMate, Safari and the Terminal, all manage fine without a built-in to do manager. I appreciate their focus on what they&#8217;re good at while separately Things does what it&#8217;s good at.</p>



<p>I want to listen to music while I edit photos, compose email and browse the web, would it make sense to add an MP3 player to Photoshop, another to Mail and have Safari implement its own too? The same goes for task management.</p>



<p>The to do UI in Cha-Ching is attractive and functional which makes it worse. To know that valuable development time and effort has been spent implementing a feature completely unrelated and unnecessary while there&#8217;s so much room for improvement in <em>finance</em>, the reason Cha-Ching exists in the first place, is extremely frustrating.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/03/26/new-microsoft-ads">Daring Fireball</a>:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Odd new Microsoft commercial, which purports to show a real person named Lauren trying to find a new 17-inch laptop for under $1000. She goes into “the Mac store” and comes out disappointed, because — and this is true — the only sub-$1000 laptop comes with a 13-inch display. But then she says, “I’m just not cool enough to be a Mac person.” One can only assume that it’s intended as an anti-elitist insult, but the bottom line is that Microsoft is explicitly reinforcing the idea that Macs are cool, which strikes me as a very odd tactic. The theme of the commercial seems to be “PCs: Computers for Losers”.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>So Lauren comes out of the Apple store, can&#8217;t get what she wants under her budget then concludes that her problem is that she&#8217;s not cool enough?</p>



<p>Analogy: I have $2, I want a burger with two meat patties, lettuce and tomato. I go to McDonalds, the burger I want, a Big Mac, is $4, double my budget so instead I get a cheeseburger and conclude that I&#8217;m just not cool enough to eat a Big Mac.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve noticed a trend over the last few years of laptop computers being chosen over desktop computers regardless of where or how they&#8217;ll be used. When people first started getting computers in their homes <em>no one</em> had laptops. It was rare to even see a laptop 10 years ago.</p>



<p>Now they&#8217;re everywhere.</p>



<p>The head designer at a print shop I worked at during university used a 17&#8221;, $4000 laptop that not once, during my 6 months stay there, moved from her desk. For half the price she could have had an iMac with a 24&#8221; display and more power.</p>



<p>I was surprised to find out that many of my classmates who took notes in a notebook had laptops at home they never brought to class.</p>



<p>I rented a ute from a car rental shop down the street from me a few weeks ago. In their office sat a small laptop hooked up to an ethernet cable, printer, external keyboard, mouse and hard drive.</p>



<p>My girlfriend owns a laptop who&#8217;s greatest journey has been a move from one part of her desk to another. She didn&#8217;t choose the laptop, it got given to her but when she decided she wanted to upgrade her instinct was laptop, despite the years worth of evidence she doesn&#8217;t need a portable computer.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t understand it. Desktops are more powerful, have bigger screens, are easier to expand, more comfortable to operate and still <em>cost less</em>. The premium you pay for a laptop covers one thing: portability, if you&#8217;re never going to move it, save your money, get a better desktop.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A series of excerpts from the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0060898771/ref=ord_cart_shr?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;v=glance">Emergency: This Book Will Save Your Life</a>:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>“I’m looking at islands in the north, around Iceland, because no one will think of looking for anyone there,” Spencer said, his thick lips spreading into a self-satisfied smile. “If I can get some other B people [billionaires] to go there with me, we can build underground homes and use geothermal energy.”</p>

</blockquote>



<p>It&#8217;s a gimmicky title but judging by the excerpts, it sounds great. The problem with books (or websites or guides or classes) on this subject is that they&#8217;re based heavily on secrets which cease to be secrets once they&#8217;re published internationally. A St Kitts passport might have worked wonders a few years ago but what happens when tens of thousands of American citizens start applying for them?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2213793/">Slate</a> on Comcast&#8217;s meaningless and somewhat creepy <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYWxV_gR9ro&amp;fmt=18">dream big commercial</a>.</p>



<p>The marketing department and rest of the company work in opposition. The company&#8217;s products fail and the service sucks. Consumers hate the company. Nothing but bad experiences come to mind when thinking of the company. What&#8217;s the solution? Make a fucking commercial full of people in a miniature animated world singing about how great the company is. Finish it with &#8216;DREAM BIG&#8217;, a slogan contrived and meaningless in <em>any situation</em> let alone when related to a cable provider.</p>



<p>Ditch the bullshit marketing, invest the money in great service and making a great product and the marketing will take care of itself.</p>

<p><a href="http://thecosmicmachine.com/">EventBox</a> is the non-HUD Twitter app I&#8217;ve been looking for.

As well as Twitter it handles a few other social networks side by side: Flickr and Facebook most notably.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s in beta so can be a little buggy, the text isn&#8217;t easy to read and I don&#8217;t like the way everything requires a read/unread status. I read everything from Twitter but definitely not from Facebook where I couldn&#8217;t care less if I&#8217;ve seen the update or not.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I like to think of the financial crisis not as a disaster but as a correction.</p>



<p>During times of prosperity our means increase and we indulge in luxuries we couldn&#8217;t previously afford. Often the luxuries are beyond even our new found means because of the false promise of further prosperity. Enough time with these luxuries and they become the status quo. Recede one step backwards over a year and it feels like a crisis, despite the 10 steps forward you&#8217;ve taken during the 10 years previous.</p>



<p>If businesses can&#8217;t afford staff that do nothing, social media consultants fail to get contracts for the contrived, pointless job they do or car manufacturers struggle to sell the same bland, overpriced, void-of-any-innovation machines they&#8217;ve been pedalling for the last 30 years, so what?</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a trimming down, forcing people to do real jobs, do them well and forcing business to innovate and cut the fat from their operations. It pushes people to live back within their means and change their opulent lifestyle that existed on borrowed money.</p>



<p>If all the financial crisis does is force everyone into a simpler, less ostentatious lifestyle then I welcome the recession.</p>

The feature is a gorgeous 25 metre pool. There&#8217;s an ocean swim and triathlon coming up in Byron Bay, I&#8217;d love to stay there but it&#8217;s a bit beyond my budget at over $350/night.
