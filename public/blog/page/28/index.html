  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/"><img src="/assets/tumblr/oaQecruTZm9z84d27NxOB2G7o1_500.png"/></a></p><p>Tomorrow will mark my 5th day at my first full time job. It&#8217;s a web developer position at <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/">ABC News Online</a>. That is the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, a government funded, non-commercial national broadcaster. They have two national TV channels, heaps of local radio stations around the country, produce many of their own news and current affairs programs and run an online news department. They have a reputation for quality and substance that other free-to-air broadcasters in Australia lack.</p>



<p>The news site serves around 600,000 visits per day depending on big news stories and makes up the vast majority of the ABC&#8217;s website traffic. We have a massive amount of constantly fresh and deep archives of content and statistics to work with, it&#8217;s my job to make it accessible and usable on the web.</p>



<p>The setup of the site borders between hacked together and ingenious. I&#8217;m learning a lot about scaling, caching and legacy systems.</p>



<p>Before starting at the ABC I saw corporate web development as an isolated bubble void of innovation, up to date practices, standards support or regard for the web in the real world. My colleagues are better than any freelance or small team developer I&#8217;ve come across. They&#8217;re knowledge is up to the minute, as is their skill and I was surprised to find a high level of flexibility, innovation, openness to ideas and an absence of bureaucracy.</p>



<p>Currently I use a temporary PC at the office which is really slowing me down. I&#8217;ve requested a Mac, another team uses them in Sydney but my hopes aren&#8217;t high. If I don&#8217;t get one ABC issued I&#8217;ll upgrade my PowerBook to a MacBook and use that at work. I can work five times as fast and have more fun doing it in OS X, it&#8217;s worth it when I&#8217;m spending eight hours a day there.</p>



<p>The other issue is my home&#8217;s distance from work. It&#8217;s not <em>huge</em> but it requires a change of trains in the city and that plus walking to the station at both ends adds up to about <strong>four hours a day</strong> travelling on top of the eight hours I&#8217;m already working. It&#8217;s too much. Factor in eating and sleeping and I&#8217;m left with only a couple of hours spare each day.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve wanted to get out of home for a long time so as soon as a few pay cheques come in Kristin and I are going to find a place within walking or cycling distance of the city and our workplaces. My commute time will be cut to 15 enjoyable minutes each way and I&#8217;ll save three and a half hours per day. I&#8217;m looking forward to it but until then I&#8217;ll tough it out.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.marco.org/95613967">Translations from Park Slope real-estate listings to real life</a></p><p>I&#8217;m really enjoying Marco&#8217;s series on looking for an apartment to rent. Despite being on opposite sides of the planet I think we&#8217;re looking for a pretty similar type of place.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re a month off seriously looking for a place but from just a few hours browsing the listings on <a href="http://www.realestate.com.au/">realestate.com.au</a> and <a href="http://www.domain.com.au/">Domain</a> the ridiculous &#8220;sales&#8221; tactics (or complete incompetence) of real estate agents is obvious. The amount of listings with a single photo of the view or the exterior of an apartment building <em>and nothing else</em> is incredible. Then there&#8217;s the listings without any photos at all or with photos so low in resolution and quality it&#8217;s impossible to tell what colour the carpet is or whether the floor&#8217;s carpeted at all.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.marco.org/94597755">Marco Pulls Apart a Microsoft Sponsored Study on the &#8220;Apple Tax&#8221;</a></p><p>I totally agree that Apple stuff is overpriced as far as the high end stuff goes, that is, Macbook Pros and Mac Pros. Although that could just be a hunch because I&#8217;ve never researched a PC with identical or very similar specifications to Apple&#8217;s top of the line computers.</p>



<p>But when it comes to the consumer stuff, Macbooks, iMacs and Mac Minis, the prices are on par. Find a PC with the same specs as a Macbook and it costs about the same. You see really cheap, sub $1000 PC laptops because they&#8217;re simply not as good, Apple don&#8217;t even make a comparable computer so comparing a bottom of the range $600 Dell to a $1600 Macbook on price is unfair.</p>



<p>If Microsoft truly believed there was an Apple Tax on consumer computers then there&#8217;d be no need to rig the study with all the bullshit Marco points out.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>A great deal of fawning over notebooks and pens happens on the internet. Curiously it happens most with people more than competent with a computer. Gus Mueller, software developer, <a href="http://gusmueller.com/blog/archives/2009/03/developer_notebooks.html">on notebooks</a>:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>I learned a long time ago that the two best debugging tools I own are a nice piece of paper, and a good pencil.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>I don&#8217;t know whether Gus means this literally but if you&#8217;ve been in an exam that required writing code to answer questions you&#8217;ll know a flattened tree is pretty fucking useless when it comes to debugging. No doubt it&#8217;s great for working through easily visualised problems like trigonometry but the <em>best</em> debugging tool? I disagree.</p>



<p>Like <a href="http://mrgan.tumblr.com/post/91484728/man-without-a-notebook">Neven</a> I don&#8217;t <em>get</em> notebooks. Despite all the UIs I&#8217;ve created, programming problems I&#8217;ve solved and hundreds of words I write a day, I manage without a notebook, it&#8217;s possible.</p>



<p>They&#8217;re impractical, laborious to fill out, the contents completely inflexible once recorded, they&#8217;re impossible to organise, aren&#8217;t searchable, sharable or able to be backed up.</p>



<p>I think it&#8217;s a romantic idea — a rugged intellectual in a world where no one reads let alone writes. In lives dominated by computers people like to think the raw materials of a notebook and pen are still the best way, as far as I&#8217;m concerned, it&#8217;s not.</p>

  <p>Retirees Dick and Anne Saplata work out by walking around the largely empty halls of the Metcalf South Mall in Leawood, Kan. It’s likely to close soon, and there’s talk that a developer will raze the place. If the mall goes under, Dick Saplata asks, “where are we going to walk?”</p>

  <p>“The most important fact about our shopping malls,” says social scientist Henry Fairlie, “is that we do not need most of what they sell.”</p>

<p>The way it&#8217;s been shot with fleeting split second images of the cars, the Audi black and the rest silver make it difficult to actually compare the cars. Here&#8217;s a side by side with the Audi Q5 and Lexus RX which from what I can tell is the other car featured in the commercial.</p>

<p>Sure, Audi markets themselves as a rebel, the enemy of convention but the truth is they&#8217;re making the same boring, almost identical cars as every other manufacturer.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://static.jimwhimpey.com/images/chaching2.png"><img src="/assets/tumblr/oaQecruTZlnz714cwbtT1U2qo1_500.png"/></a></p><p><a href="http://www.midnightapps.com/chaching/">Cha-Ching</a> is the best in a bad bunch of personal finance managers for OS X. A beta of the next major version was released recently and with it, a companion iPhone application. Exciting stuff if you&#8217;re a long time Cha-Ching user hoping for more.</p>



<p>Despite the gaps and room for improvement in the first version, the most notable feature in the new beta is <strong>to dos</strong>. To dos barely belong in iCal. Incredibly, they were added to Mail and now <em>Cha-Ching</em>, a finance application, has integrated to do management. Think of any two, unrelated applications and integrate their functionality: instant messaging in Photoshop, web browsing into iTunes or feed reading into TextMate, that&#8217;s how much sense it makes. There&#8217;s already a slew of great, dedicated to do applications out there, the functionality already exists in two applications that ship with OS X (not that it should).</p>



<p>I emailed Midnight Apps with my thoughts. They argue that there&#8217;s tasks like paying bills that relate to finance so it makes sense to have to do management integrated with a finance application. The majority of my 900 completed tasks recorded in <a href="http://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a>, a dedicated to do application, are completed in TextMate, Safari and the Terminal, all manage fine without a built-in to do manager. I appreciate their focus on what they&#8217;re good at while separately Things does what it&#8217;s good at.</p>



<p>I want to listen to music while I edit photos, compose email and browse the web, would it make sense to add an MP3 player to Photoshop, another to Mail and have Safari implement its own too? The same goes for task management.</p>



<p>The to do UI in Cha-Ching is attractive and functional which makes it worse. To know that valuable development time and effort has been spent implementing a feature completely unrelated and unnecessary while there&#8217;s so much room for improvement in <em>finance</em>, the reason Cha-Ching exists in the first place, is extremely frustrating.</p>
