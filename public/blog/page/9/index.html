Hell, he was commentating cricket 15 years <em>before I was born</em>. Benaud&#8217;s voice evokes a feeling of Summer in me more strongly than hot weather, swimming or eating ice blocks. A huge void will remain when he leaves as he eventually must.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>First it was <a href="http://flock.com/">Flock</a> now RockMelt is adding bullshit to browser chrome. I can&#8217;t even think of an analogy for <em>adding a subset of a website to the chrome of software made for accessing the same complete websites as its primary functionality</em>.</p>



<p>A car with another smaller car inside it that doesn&#8217;t go as fast or as far?</p>



<p>The list of features in the screenshot — share easily, connect with friends, search faster, keep up on news — are all things any browser can do today by simply <em>visiting websites</em>. It&#8217;s impossible to tell what those avatars down the left hand edge represent but why would you ever want a row of faces constantly staring back at you while you&#8217;re browsing?</p>



<p>Shit like this seems to be a momentum gaining trend of social media being treated as though it has inherent value. The &#8220;features&#8221; RockMelt adds to Chrome may not be useful and they may actually detract from the web browsing experience but because it&#8217;s social media it&#8217;s considered valuable.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As a cyclist who races regularly and who&#8217;s been in major and minor accidents whenever I&#8217;m out on the bike I&#8217;m hyper aware of what&#8217;s happening around me. This transfers to all areas of my life. Despite not owning a car for a couple of years I&#8217;m a much better driver now than I was when I drove daily. I notice things in and appreciate my immediate environment.</p>



<p>When I saw Frank Chimero&#8217;s <a href="http://blog.frankchimero.com/post/1374646378/the-being-there-diary">being there diary</a> idea I wondered, why do people find this so hard?</p>



<p>Not all that long ago it seemed to only be those listening to music, fucking with their phones or reading books (!) who were oblivious to the world around them. Now it&#8217;s even those not using any sort of sensory noise maker that fail to notice they&#8217;re about to walk directly into me.</p>



<p>I consider it profoundly rude to purposefully shut yourself off from the world with something like headphones in almost any public situation but seeing people walk around like zombies <em>anyway</em> just makes me sad.</p>

<p>I love the way he&#8217;s all excited about the way you can set CSS properties using a little non-native GUI palette. Developers love writing simple code via a barrage GUI clicking. If this is Adobe&#8217;s push into the new web they&#8217;re going to fail, It&#8217;s clear they don&#8217;t get it. In fact, there&#8217;s no such thing as animation in HTML5, it&#8217;s got to be either CSS3 or JavaScript, so I don&#8217;t know why they&#8217;re calling it a HTML5 animation editor at all.</p>



<p>Ironically enough, the demo <a href="http://cl.ly/8fbf7090fc45e8815246">requires Flash</a>.</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>The professor, who admitted to being a little lax when it came to backing up data on his laptop, had left the bag hidden behind the stairwell of his apartment block when he made a short detour to the laundry room. Soon after, he realised his bag had vanished along with ten years of precious data.

  [&#8230;]

  The calendar is extremely important. It is my life. Here I have documented the last ten years and beyond,” he said.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>This professor is not only reckless enough to keep a <em>single copy</em> of his entire life&#8217;s work on a laptop but he then thinks it&#8217;ll be safe to temporarily &#8220;hide it&#8221; in a semi-public place while he does his laundry. He didn&#8217;t deserve to have his data returned.</p>

<br/><br/>I think about this whenever I come across something like a .sitx file, the previously ubitquitous wrapper for shareware on the Mac.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As far as simply enjoying a video goes I <em>love</em> this commercial from Microsoft. It beautifully ridicules a phenomenon that really annoys me and that I&#8217;m ever conscious of <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/737271650">avoiding personally</a>. But as a sales pitch for a phone? <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/garrettmurray/status/27074080635">Garrett Murray</a>:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Point of new Windows 7 Phone commercials seems to be &#8220;Tired of that phone you love using all the time? You won&#8217;t wanna use ours that much.&#8221;</p>

</blockquote>



<p>It&#8217;s a great commercial for being present and connected to the physical world around you rather than for a phone.</p>



<p>Compare with the <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/gallery/ads.html#ad-every">iPhone ads</a> which show nothing but the phone in use.</p>

	        <h2 class="entry-title">The Marketing Department</h2>
	      
			
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Through a friend I heard about <a href="http://www.theapplebrisbane.com.au/">The Apple apartments</a>, a new building being built in the city full of one bedrooms for a reasonable price. My idea of an <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/271313749">ideal home</a> has always been one bedroom (ish), although a house rather an apartment but that&#8217;s unrealistic as close as I want to be to the city.</p>



<p>Perhaps being in the market for something like this in the near future I naturally looked them up online. The main thing I was looking for was a completion date, instead I get:</p>



<ul><li>An unskippable Flash splash page.</li>

<li>A video of the same model doing various activities in different outfits cut between stock footage of Brisbane.</li>

<li>Flash slideshows of the same model doing more various things.</li>

<li>Meaningless marketing gobbledegook such as:

<blockquote style="margin-top: 10px;">We have a new world city view on life. The world is now full of fast energy with intelligent phones, wireless internet, casual working hours and a commitment to being kind to the environment.</blockquote></li>

<li>Information embedded in PDFs displayed using an insane Flash app with an excruciatingly slow page turn animation and <em>sound effects</em>.</li>

<li>A 56 page brochure made up almost entirely of full page photographs of the same model doing various activities, stock images and random photos of the city with text overlays saying things like “make a difference” and “it’s all yours”.</li>

</ul><p>When I was told simply what they were, one bedroom apartments, priced well and in a great location, I was very interested.  When I find try to find out more from their official marketing I&#8217;m thoroughly put off the entire thing.</p>



<p>Just like when I find myself being swayed by a well done advertising campaign that focuses on anything but product I remind myself that the marketing department and the product department are disconnected parties. In many cases the marketing department probably isn&#8217;t even part of the company. A good advertising campaign doesn&#8217;t mean a good product.</p>



<p>It works both ways, The Apple Apartments terrible marketing material doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean the product is terrible but it sure makes it difficult.</p>

<p>I made this to scratch my own itch. The radar annoys me because 90% of the time it&#8217;s the same (literally, the turnover is really low) crap. Recommended blogs annoys me because the recommendations are bad. Tumblr Tuesday annoys me because it&#8217;s set to show on US time which is Wednesday my time and I don&#8217;t follow any blogs which fall into the categories it defines. They&#8217;re all distractions I could do without. The radar and recommended blogs have hide toggles but they very quickly forget about being hidden and I&#8217;ve gotten sick of clicking the hide button.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/video/2010/09/24/3021586.htm">Kerry O&#8217;Brien Leaves The 7.30 Report</a></p><p>After 45 years in journalism and 15 years as the host of The 7.30 Report this is truly the end of an era. For as long as I can remember Kerry O&#8217;Brien has been the only journalist legitimately holding politicians feet to the fire.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s strange listening to Kerry on the other side of the table but there&#8217;s some great stuff in this interview with Colvin. In response to questions of his neutrality in the recent election campaign:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>I would think anybody who sat down and looked at playbacks of both sets of interviews that I did in that campaign would be rather embarrassed if they persisted with that line.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>And on interviewing John Howard:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>He was a tough person to interview. Much in the way that I would imagine it&#8217;d be like bowling to Geoff Boycott. In that he played a very straight bat and often a very defensive bat but if a loose ball came along he was very quick to dispatch it.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>What other national news program anchor would use a cricket analogy to describe 12 years of interviews with a Prime Minister? It&#8217;s people like Kerry O&#8217;Brien who make me proud to work for the ABC over any other media organisation.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote>When people find it necessary to inform their friends about how unbearably arid and stultifying their lives are &#8212; which they do at a rate of roughly 2,000 status updates an hour &#8212; the word they choose most often is &#8220;boring.</blockquote><p>Gene Weingarten <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/17/AR2010091704716.html?hpid=topnews">spends a little time with Openbook</a> and quantifies  something I see first hand every day from my own Facebook friends.</p>



<p>The thought of being bored boggles my mind. I&#8217;m constantly dismissing practical things I&#8217;d love to do because time is limited. I&#8217;m constantly evaluating the things I do spend my time on questioning whether it&#8217;s really what I want to be doing more than all those things I don&#8217;t do. We live in an world where amazing things are always at our fingertips. I couldn&#8217;t imagine being bored if I lived to 250 years.

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txdv_oNq81I">Climbing a 1768&#8217; Guided Tower</a></p><p>I&#8217;m probably a little more scared of heights than most so watching this makes me feel sick. Just after they get out of the partially caged area the narrator says:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>This is called free climbing so no safely lines are used.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>The stuff my nightmares are made of.</p>

While it seems there&#8217;s still nothing out there that&#8217;s solved this problem it might be a great project to take on myself as I learn Cocoa and Objective-C.</p>
