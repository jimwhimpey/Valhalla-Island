  <div class="entry-content"><p>Every Mac blog I used to follow for their insightful computer and software analysis and opinion has now diverted almost their entire attention to, in this order, mobile phones in general, App Store criticism, AT&amp;T, Verizon and the iPhone.</p>



<p>It sucks.</p>



<p>I like my iPhone and it&#8217;s certainly a useful, informative and enjoyable upgrade from my old phone. I believe it&#8217;s the best mobile phone available by a long shot. That&#8217;s where my interest in all mobile phones and mobile phone infrastructure ends. My carrier in Australia, Optus, isn&#8217;t fantastic and I barely care about <em>that</em>, let alone what sounds like an equally not perfect carrier in AT&amp;T, <em>let alone the rival to AT&amp;T</em>.</p>



<p>As for the App Store, the apps I use regularly, Instapaper, Tumblr and Tweetie were available for me to purchase in the store and I enjoy them. Updates take a while to come through the system and as a consumer, the one forking out money, I don&#8217;t care. My iPhone is a secondary device, if I lost my phone for a week it wouldn&#8217;t be a huge deal, I can wait a while for a bug to be fixed in an application I use 1 hour total per week while I sit on the train.</p>



<p>I used to pore over every word written at <a href="http://daringfireball.net/">Daring Fireball</a> but now I find myself completely skipping the majority of posts.</p>



<p>The obsession has moved so far beyond the iPhone and into everything however remotely connected to it. An app is forced to have a 17+ rating, HTC releases a new phone, Verizon run an ad campaign, Google releases a phone, HTC releases another phone. As far as I&#8217;m concerned it&#8217;s the equivalent of writing in depth about every shitty new laptop Dell releases. I&#8217;m sad to have lost some of my favourite writing to a topic I care so little about.</p>

	        <h2 class="entry-title">GPS Cycling Tracking Software Options Review</h2>
	      
			
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Before I got my <a href="https://buy.garmin.com/shop/shop.do?pID=10885">Garmin Edge 705</a> I was using the iPhone + <a href="http://runkeeper.com/">RunKeeper</a> combo. RunKeeper was for simply tracking the distances I was riding before I had a bike computer rather than for any kind of analysis. I get much more data out of the Garmin and it&#8217;s lead me head first into a category of software I hadn&#8217;t previously explored.</p>



<p>The options are numerous both online and client side but each have their own sets of positives, negatives and quirks. I&#8217;ll attempt to summarise my findings over the last week.</p>



<h3><a href="http://runkeeper.com/">RunKeeper</a></h3>



<p>The website presents the relatively small amount of data RunKeeper collects well. Every other app here has features that stretch beyond what RunKeeper&#8217;s can provide. If all you have is an iPhone this is without a doubt the way to go.</p>



<p><strong>Positives</strong></p>



<ul><li>Great graph and map integration. Hover over the graph and it shows you the point on the map.</li>

<li>Great looking, readable graphs.</li>

<li>Good presentation of summary data like total distance, average speed, etc.</li>

<li>No need to upload anything, taken care of by the iPhone app.</li>

<li>Nice simple date based method of managing rides.</li>

<li>Being web based, easy to share.</li>

</ul><p><strong>Negatives</strong></p>



<ul><li>Inflexible. Small map that you can&#8217;t make bigger without hiding the graph.</li>

<li>Bad map presentation, in Map view it&#8217;s difficult to make out the path.</li>

<li>You have to use an iPhone. This is the biggest negative. Starting, stopping and pausing is cumbersome as the phone is in a pocket and often in a protective bag. The GPS also churns through the battery, it&#8217;ll completely drain on a 3 hour ride.</li>

</ul><h3><a href="http://connect.garmin.com/">Garmin Connect</a></h3>



<p>I was wary of Garmin Connect. Their client side software <em>sucks</em> and I thought Connect would be not much more than a bullet point on Garmin product&#8217;s feature lists. My concern was unfounded, Connect is highly polished and functional. I&#8217;d go as far to say it&#8217;s one of the better web applications out there.</p>



<p><strong>Positives</strong></p>



<ul><li>Good looking website that&#8217;s all round, easy to use and navigate.</li>

<li>Attractive, readable graphs.</li>

<li>Easy to get data from your device to Connect with their totally unobtrusive browser plugin.</li>

<li>Simple and useful reporting UI.</li>

<li>Being web based, easy to share.</li>

</ul><p><strong>Negatives</strong></p>



<ul><li>No map to graph interaction outside of a cumbersome Flash &#8220;player&#8221;.</li>

<li>No ability to layer graphs or compare rides.</li>

<li>Somewhat inflexible, you can&#8217;t enlarge the map or graphs.</li>

</ul><h3><a href="http://www.rubitrack.com/">Rubitrack</a></h3>



<p>Rubitrack is well put together and organised, a major advantage. UI conventions are followed and everything works the way you expect it to. The source list works like a contextual bunch of smart folders and it&#8217;s my favourite way any of these applications organise rides. But while it does some things brilliantly, it does others poorly.</p>



<p><strong>Positives</strong></p>



<ul><li>Well organised, Mac like UI.</li>

<li>Crystal clear map that visually represents zones.</li>

</ul><p><strong>Negatives</strong></p>



<ul><li>Crappy graphs in many ways. No interaction with the map, visually confusing and doesn&#8217;t display precise readings on hover. In practice, they&#8217;re static jpegs.</li>

<li>Forces you to save and maintain a library <em>file</em> which it doesn&#8217;t automatically load on next open. I hate this convention. When I&#8217;m using an application to interact with a &#8220;library&#8221; of something, I don&#8217;t want to manage afile, I don&#8217;t want to save or open, I want the data side of things to be invisible. I can&#8217;t think of any situation where I&#8217;d want to manage multiple Rubitrack libraries simultaneously.</li>

<li>The calendar view has potential but is poorly executed.</li>

</ul><h3><a href="http://trailrunnerx.com/">TrailRunner</a></h3>



<p>For donationware TrailRunner is surprisingly good but tries to be too much at the expense of absolutely nailing what it already does well. In some areas it&#8217;s polished to perfection, in others it almost seems broken.</p>



<p><strong>Positives</strong></p>



<ul><li>The best looking graphs of any of the applications listed here. Far and away the most well thought out and executed. Very easy to read layered graphs.</li>

<li>Ability to select a section of the graph which it will then display averages for and display that selection on the map. A brilliant idea that no other app has implemented let alone done so well.</li>

<li>Great looking maps and seamless graph + map integration.</li>

</ul><p><strong>Negatives</strong></p>



<ul><li>Disorganised UI. Sometimes I will get lost and don&#8217;t know how to get back to my list of rides. Labels are messy and unclear.</li>

<li>Some functions popup confusing windows which aren&#8217;t obvious how they integrate into the rest of the application.</li>

<li>Ugly, annoying copyright banner on the bottom of the map. I assume this is a requirement for map use without a commercial license but it&#8217;s distracting.</li>

<li>The same frustrating save file model as Rubitrack.</li>

</ul><h3><a href="http://www.montebellosoftware.com/index.html">Ascent</a></h3>



<p>Ascent is the Final Cut Pro of this category of applications. Raw UI with every kind of function at your disposal. The UI is just plain ugly and acts strangely, drop down buttons act like toggle switches and new windows are opened all over the place. It&#8217;s a powerful application but I can&#8217;t look past the unpolished UI.</p>



<p><strong>Positives</strong></p>



<ul><li>The option to dim the map background results in the best looking maps out of any application here.</li>

<li>There&#8217;s a great map view that shows your zones along the route. I don&#8217;t understand why this isn&#8217;t the default.</li>

</ul><p><strong>Negatives</strong></p>



<ul><li>Map and graph interaction is only possible when you have the graph popup open even though a graph exists as part of the main window.</li>

<li><em>Again</em>, Ascent forces you to manage library files! Why do they do this?! Could you imagine having to manually save your iTunes library every time you added a song to a playlist or change the smallest piece of meta data.</li>

<li>I simply can&#8217;t tolerate the interface and interaction quirks. There&#8217;s one text box which <em>opens up a modal text box</em> when it gains focus. Frustrating to use.</li>

</ul><h3><a href="http://www.garmin.com/garmin/cms/us/intosports/training_center">Garmin Training Center</a></h3>



<p>Granted it&#8217;s a &#8220;beta&#8221; but Garmin Training Center is too bad to dwell on. Don&#8217;t waste your time.</p>



<h3>Conclusion</h3>



<p>There is definitely no clear winner. All the client side options have the requirement for saving library files which pisses me off so much it&#8217;s a deal breaker across the board. Although each of them have their own individual pitfalls outside of the file issue. For now I&#8217;m sticking with Garmin Connect, although it lacks some features, it makes up for it by doing what it does do well. The UI is polished and and great reporting tools which I appreciate.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve looked into the files that my Garmin Edge collects and they&#8217;re nothing more than simple XML files which opens it up for me to play with this data myself. I had a great time creating the graph on <a href="http://ride.jimwhimpey.com">ride.jimwhimpey.com</a> with <a href="http://raphaeljs.com/">Raphael</a>, so I&#8217;m looking forward to diving into my cycling data with <a href="http://g.raphaeljs.com/">Graphael</a> and perhaps complimenting Garmin Connect with my own software.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Initially Stuff You Should Know sounded right up my alley. Unfortunately it is not what I hoped it would be: the concise distillation of interesting information organised into a tight presentation. Instead it&#8217;s two dudes having a long-winded, ragtag chat about the topic. There&#8217;s moments of good stuff but what could be a great 10 minute show is 30 minutes of mostly blather between a pair of bros.</p>

It&#8217;s incredible that whoever devised this system failed to see the irony.</p>



<p>Then I find out that if I&#8217;m only using their dashboard widget and therefore not giving them money, I <em>can&#8217;t</em> unsubscribe at all. Fuck you IceTV.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I refuse to believe that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gruen_transfer">Gruen Transfer</a> helps retail in any way. The kind of store that tends to stock the clothes I like, department stores, are notoriously the most &#8220;effective&#8221; implementors of the Gruen Transfer.</p>



<p>They scatter their clothes throughout a huge area. Shorts, T-shirts, collared shirts and jackets are all dispersed over 50m². It&#8217;s impossible to compare the range and you&#8217;re forced to walk around.</p>



<p>When you finally find the clothes you want, you then have to find where to pay for it.</p>



<p>Surely frustrating your shoppers by forcing them to search for similar items and a place to pay for them couldn&#8217;t possibly outweigh helping shoppers find what they want and pay for it as efficiently as possible.</p>



<p>I imagine department store executives: <em>&#8220;I know! We&#8217;ll disorient our customers, make it difficult to browse our entire range and force them search for the place where they give us their money!&#8221;</em></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It was my birthday over the weekend and I was lucky to get some great presents from my loved ones.</p>



<p><strong><a href="http://buy.garmin.com/shop/products/products/edge705/">Garmin Edge 705</a></strong> from <em>Kristin</em>.

Literally the best bike computer available. Speed, cadence, power, heart rate, altitude, maps and GPS. It has a ton of dashboard style display options and is easy to upload and analyse at <a href="http://connect.garmin.com/explore?owner=jimwhimpey">Garmin Connect</a>, a beautifully polished web application.</p>



<p><strong><a href="http://www.apple.com/airportextreme/">Airport Extreme</a></strong> from <em>My Mum</em>.

Completely sick of my ISP provided, flakey piece of shit wireless router it&#8217;s great to finally get something reliable. The N protocol is more than noticeably faster when transferring big files. I&#8217;m yet to put it through its paces streaming HD video to the Xbox.</p>



<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Its-Not-About-Bike-Journey/dp/0399146113">It&#8217;s Not About the Bike</a></strong> from <em>Kristin</em>.

The amazing story of Lance Armstrong. A book I&#8217;ve wanted for a long time. I&#8217;m a quarter of the way in and can barely put it down.</p>



<p><strong><a href="http://www.allenandunwin.com/default.aspx?page=94&amp;book=9781741755596">50 Marathons 50 Days</a></strong> from <em>My Sister</em>.

Just looking at the cover of this book is inspiring. This is the same guy that ran 260 consecutive miles over 76 hours.</p>

	        <h2 class="entry-title">Revisiting My Ideal House Plan</h2>
	      
			
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>18 months ago I wrote about <a href="http://archive.valhallaisland.com/blog/2008/my-ideal-house/">my ideal house</a>. Back then I was still living in my large, suburban, family home, hadn&#8217;t yet graduated and didn&#8217;t have much of a job. The old plan looked like this:</p>



<p><a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3078/2608929789_b254910584_o.png"><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ku7ot4uyUx1qzw2y9.png" alt="The Old Plan"/></a></p>



<p>Things couldn&#8217;t be much more different now. I have a job that pays well and I&#8217;ve lived 5 minutes outside the city in an apartment with my girlfriend for the better part of a year.</p>



<p>After 8 months living in an apartment my take on ideal living arrangements has changed — but not much. Most of the points I raised in my original post stand true now. Free standing houses beat apartments for windows and backyards, houses are usually much too large, one bathroom is enough, dining rooms are a waste of space, an outdoor area is important. I still agree with all these things and I think my original plan stands up well, I&#8217;d happily live alone in it today.</p>



<p>There was one glaring omission from the original plan that I mentioned but didn&#8217;t address, the complete lack of storage beyond a single wardrobe. I&#8217;m <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/266183205">not one</a> to needlessly keep much but often it&#8217;s unavoidable and it&#8217;s frustrating not having enough space or the right space kind to store things.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s the main issue I&#8217;ve tried to address in my revised plan but there&#8217;s lots of other stuff there too:</p>



<p><a href="http://static.jimwhimpey.com/images/idealhouseplan2.png"><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ku7ocdrWJH1qzw2y9.png" alt="The New Plan"/></a></p>



<p>At first it looks <em>much</em> bigger, something I&#8217;m trying to avoid but note that I&#8217;ve included the patio/verandah area in this plan and as one floor is a basement, the overall footprint has only increased about 15%.</p>



<p>The biggest addition is the basement. You&#8217;d be hard pressed to find a house in Australia with a basement which is crazy, they&#8217;re a great, efficient use of space and could provide respite from the Summer heat. It addresses the lack of storage with the room on the left totally dedicated to it. I imagine lining those walls with shelves and cupboards, all removable to keep that room flexible.</p>



<p>The rest of the basement is multipurpose. It&#8217;s somewhat a typical garage space but I don&#8217;t own a car and don&#8217;t think cars belong inside anyway. Part laundry, part place to keep my bikes, bike paraphernalia, other training equipment and tools.</p>



<p>The door on the right wall of the basement is a typical garage roller door. Having to go to a separate garage or dragging my bike through the apartment sucks when I&#8217;m going in and out on bikes 4 times or more every day.  I imagine a ramp driveway cut into the ground to get down there. It&#8217;s not space efficient but I don&#8217;t see another way. That and the space stealing need for stairs are the worst thing about the addition of a basement.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve pulled the study into it&#8217;s own room. I have too much computer related <em>stuff</em> that&#8217;d clutter up the lounge room area. I also like the idea of totally concentrating on getting things done when in the office and using a laptop outside or on the couch for more &#8220;recreational&#8221; computing.</p>



<p>Basically it&#8217;s the same plan with additional storage and garage space.</p>



<p><strong>Production Notes</strong></p>



<p>Again <a href="http://static.jimwhimpey.com/images/idealhouseplan2.svg">I&#8217;m offering the SVG file</a> to aid others creating floor plans in their favourite vector editor. I&#8217;ve found applications like <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/OmniGraffle/">OminGraffle</a>, which should be perfect for things like this, dumb it down to the point where it hinders doing simple things.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have zero concept of sentimental value and no hoarding instinct. I like to sell the things  I don&#8217;t use any more. Recently I&#8217;ve been trying to sell an old Dell screen and a USB microphone.</p>



<p>I started at <a href="http://gumtree.com.au/">Gumtree</a> (Australia&#8217;s Craigslist (although Craigslist does cover Australia (it&#8217;s just not very popular (which is vital to these sites usefulness)))) for two reasons.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s easier, list the item for free, interested parties inquire, if they want it they come and get it in exchange for cash. Very little time investment and minimal fucking around. I also like the concept of <em>real life</em> community a site like Gumtree fosters. More people should look locally for more things.</p>



<p>Both items were on Gumtree for a month with nothing but bullshit, time wasting, substance-less enquiries. I must have had 20 &#8220;is it still for sale?&#8221; emails. Of course it&#8217;s still for sale, that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s still listed under the fucking For Sale section of Gumtree. It&#8217;s like going to a supermarket and asking if those bananas are for sale.</p>



<p>I told each person that yes, it&#8217;s still for sale with not a single follow up. It&#8217;s like they were only curious if it was still for sale, not at all interested in actually buying anything.</p>



<p>There were a number of people asking where they could pick it up, I told them, they didn&#8217;t follow up. One guy arranged to meet me and never showed, when he finally answered my call half an hour after we were supposed to meet he made up some blubbering excuse and tried to organise another meet up. No.</p>



<p>Each week I&#8217;d lower the price — well below offers that&#8217;d previously been made with no follow up — there was no change in the response.</p>



<p>In an ideal world Gumtree is <em>the</em> place for getting rid of your stuff to people genuinely interested. In reality it&#8217;s 99% tyre kickers more interested in your time than what you&#8217;ve got to sell.</p>



<p>Fed up, I list them both on Ebay with a opening price and offer nationwide shipping. Bidding activity is strong, they sell at a price I&#8217;m happy with, the buyer pays immediately, the next day I ship them both at the expense of the buyer.</p>



<p>It cost me $8 and the hassle of shipping but was 100 times easier than entertaining the deluge of bullshit Gumtree inquiries.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I <em>know</em> it&#8217;s obvious what&#8217;s wrong with this but I can&#8217;t help but talk about it, I&#8217;m <em>facinated</em>.</p>



<p>As a customer this would do nothing but annoy me. You&#8217;re trying to buy a computer and every member of the <em>huge</em> staff breaks out into a repetitive dance for <em>4 minutes</em>. I understand a computer is a big purchase but imagine trying to buy a sandwich and having the cashier dance for even <em>10 seconds</em>. It would be maddening, in both situations.</p>



<p>Speed and service are the qualities I appreciate in a retail store. Microsoft is trying to be fun, a quality no one cares about when buying things (and which Microsoft fails to achieve with their embarrassing dance <em>anyway</em>), at the expense of both.</p>



<p>From what I can see, Microsoft spends 5% of it&#8217;s resources developing a shitty operating system and the remaining 95% on ill conceived ideas to convince people to buy it anyway.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve said similar things <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/194962900">before</a>. Even if Windows seemed like a decent piece of software, I would be wary of it knowing that the <em>same company</em> thinks pulling ridiculous shit like Windows 7 launch parties and dance routines in its stores are a good idea.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: This post includes an embedded table which lacks styles when viewed in the dashboard but which I&#8217;ve meticulously styled for <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/244183453">the post when viewed on the website</a>, I suggest you view it there.</em></p>



<p>I&#8217;m obsessed with the ideal setup. I try to milk the best out of the equipment I have and think a lot about how it could be improved as my situation changes and new technology is released.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve been more than satisfied with my 24&#8221; iMac at home for a long time but I feel like I&#8217;ve <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/194075509">outgrown it</a>. The Mac Pro was the next, extremely expensive, logical step. Until the 27&#8221; iMac arrived:</p>

</tr></table><p>Equivalent CPU power and (I guess) video cards, the iMac wins on RAM and hard disk space which are both cheap enough to be negligible. So as far as computer specifications go, they&#8217;re <em>very</em> similar, if not totally equivalent out of the box.</p>



<p>The iMac comes with a gorgeous, 27&#8221; LED backlit screen the likes of which you can&#8217;t even buy individually. The Mac Pro comes with no screen. The Mac Pro is expandable with PCI cards and hard disk slots. The cost of that expandability is $1900 and the best computer screen available.</p>



<p>For many the lack of expandability is a deal breaker. If expandability is not essential, the iMac is an easy choice and I imagine many Mac Pro users will defect to the iMac come upgrade time.</p>



<p>Expandability is not essential for me but it&#8217;s desirable. Evidently Apple is able to sell a computer with the power of the Mac Pro for much less than $4,499. I wish they&#8217;d put it in the Mac Pro&#8217;s expandable case and sell it at or below the iMac&#8217;s fantastic price.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><img src="/assets/tumblr/tumblr_kt3mqvgTDG1qzwfbio1_500.jpg"/><br/><p>After seeing the irresistible <a href="http://movies.apple.com/movies/wb/watchmen/watchmen-tlr2_720p.mov">Watchmen trailer (720p .mov)</a> I saw the movie soon after it was released in cinemas. It didn&#8217;t live up to my extremely high expectations but that&#8217;s not to say I didn&#8217;t enjoy it.</p>



<p>Still, every so often I go back to the trailer and want to see the movie again. A friend from work lent me the novel and I loved it, much more than I remember enjoying the movie.</p>



<p>Today I watched the movie again. I had a greater appreciation and better understanding having seen it once before and read the novel but it still didn&#8217;t live up to its potential. Watchmen is an intricate and complex story, the movie leaves a significant amount of that out, which is definitely fine but it then adds fat elsewhere.</p>



<p>One thing the movie did get right is the opening credits. In five minutes it completely covers the background story in a series of gorgeous slow motion scenes. It&#8217;s beautifully succinct in a way the rest of the movie is not.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s <a href="http://static.jimwhimpey.com/images/rorschach.jpg">another great still from the sequence</a> and I&#8217;ve cut <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0VmXfGHG_A">an HD version of the opening credits</a> at YouTube.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have avoided <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a> for <em>so</em> long. It reeks of people who think schmoozing and fortnightly &#8220;networking breakfasts&#8221; are the way to the top, a culture I actively avoid.</p>



<p>This afternoon it was the only search result for a person I was looking for. On their LinkedIn profile was a contact link. Contacting someone requires an account.</p>



<p>Already annoying but this is my only option. I resolve to sign up, email them and close my account. Signing up is a long, multiple step process that involves email activation. After logging in I have to skip my way through a number of information harvesting, data entry screens.</p>



<p>I find the guy I&#8217;m after and look for his email address. Not an option. I can send an &#8220;InMail&#8221;. I try to send an &#8220;InMail&#8221;. Not an option, to send an InMail I need to <strong>upgrade my account</strong>.</p>



<p>For the low price of $25/month I can send 3 &#8220;InMails&#8221;.</p>



<p>No. Fucking. Way.</p>



<p>I delete my account. My avoidance was well founded.</p>



<p>Please, everyone, buy <em>yourname</em>.com, put your email address on it and stop bullshit like LinkedIn dominating a search for your name. It&#8217;s bad for you, bad for people looking for you and good for the scumbags at LinkedIn.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I couldn&#8217;t believe it this morning watching 7 Early News that <a href="http://www.forbes.com/2009/11/08/iphone-virus-attack-technology-security-rickrolling-cybersecurity.html">this</a> was being reported as an iPhone virus with no more qualification than that. It requires three things:</p>



<ol><li>A jail broken phone.</li>

<li>OpenSSH installed, not a default on most jail broken phones.</li>

<li>The default root password.</li>

</ol><p>So about 0.1% of iPhones whose users have gone out of their way to open up completely but haven&#8217;t taken the care to change their password are susceptible. Meanwhile every iPhone owner is under the impression their phones are vulnerable.</p>



<p>Don&#8217;t let the truth get in the way of a good story. Not that anyone having their iPhone background set to a picture of Rick Astley is a good story.</p>
