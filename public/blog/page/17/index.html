  <div class="entry-content"><p>It was my birthday over the weekend and I was lucky to get some great presents from my loved ones.</p>



<p><strong><a href="http://buy.garmin.com/shop/products/products/edge705/">Garmin Edge 705</a></strong> from <em>Kristin</em>.

Literally the best bike computer available. Speed, cadence, power, heart rate, altitude, maps and GPS. It has a ton of dashboard style display options and is easy to upload and analyse at <a href="http://connect.garmin.com/explore?owner=jimwhimpey">Garmin Connect</a>, a beautifully polished web application.</p>



<p><strong><a href="http://www.apple.com/airportextreme/">Airport Extreme</a></strong> from <em>My Mum</em>.

Completely sick of my ISP provided, flakey piece of shit wireless router it&#8217;s great to finally get something reliable. The N protocol is more than noticeably faster when transferring big files. I&#8217;m yet to put it through its paces streaming HD video to the Xbox.</p>



<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Its-Not-About-Bike-Journey/dp/0399146113">It&#8217;s Not About the Bike</a></strong> from <em>Kristin</em>.

The amazing story of Lance Armstrong. A book I&#8217;ve wanted for a long time. I&#8217;m a quarter of the way in and can barely put it down.</p>



<p><strong><a href="http://www.allenandunwin.com/default.aspx?page=94&amp;book=9781741755596">50 Marathons 50 Days</a></strong> from <em>My Sister</em>.

Just looking at the cover of this book is inspiring. This is the same guy that ran 260 consecutive miles over 76 hours.</p>

	        <h2 class="entry-title">Revisiting My Ideal House Plan</h2>
	      
			
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>18 months ago I wrote about <a href="http://archive.valhallaisland.com/blog/2008/my-ideal-house/">my ideal house</a>. Back then I was still living in my large, suburban, family home, hadn&#8217;t yet graduated and didn&#8217;t have much of a job. The old plan looked like this:</p>



<p><a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3078/2608929789_b254910584_o.png"><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ku7ot4uyUx1qzw2y9.png" alt="The Old Plan"/></a></p>



<p>Things couldn&#8217;t be much more different now. I have a job that pays well and I&#8217;ve lived 5 minutes outside the city in an apartment with my girlfriend for the better part of a year.</p>



<p>After 8 months living in an apartment my take on ideal living arrangements has changed â€” but not much. Most of the points I raised in my original post stand true now. Free standing houses beat apartments for windows and backyards, houses are usually much too large, one bathroom is enough, dining rooms are a waste of space, an outdoor area is important. I still agree with all these things and I think my original plan stands up well, I&#8217;d happily live alone in it today.</p>



<p>There was one glaring omission from the original plan that I mentioned but didn&#8217;t address, the complete lack of storage beyond a single wardrobe. I&#8217;m <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/266183205">not one</a> to needlessly keep much but often it&#8217;s unavoidable and it&#8217;s frustrating not having enough space or the right space kind to store things.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s the main issue I&#8217;ve tried to address in my revised plan but there&#8217;s lots of other stuff there too:</p>



<p><a href="http://static.jimwhimpey.com/images/idealhouseplan2.png"><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ku7ocdrWJH1qzw2y9.png" alt="The New Plan"/></a></p>



<p>At first it looks <em>much</em> bigger, something I&#8217;m trying to avoid but note that I&#8217;ve included the patio/verandah area in this plan and as one floor is a basement, the overall footprint has only increased about 15%.</p>



<p>The biggest addition is the basement. You&#8217;d be hard pressed to find a house in Australia with a basement which is crazy, they&#8217;re a great, efficient use of space and could provide respite from the Summer heat. It addresses the lack of storage with the room on the left totally dedicated to it. I imagine lining those walls with shelves and cupboards, all removable to keep that room flexible.</p>



<p>The rest of the basement is multipurpose. It&#8217;s somewhat a typical garage space but I don&#8217;t own a car and don&#8217;t think cars belong inside anyway. Part laundry, part place to keep my bikes, bike paraphernalia, other training equipment and tools.</p>



<p>The door on the right wall of the basement is a typical garage roller door. Having to go to a separate garage or dragging my bike through the apartment sucks when I&#8217;m going in and out on bikes 4 times or more every day.  I imagine a ramp driveway cut into the ground to get down there. It&#8217;s not space efficient but I don&#8217;t see another way. That and the space stealing need for stairs are the worst thing about the addition of a basement.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve pulled the study into it&#8217;s own room. I have too much computer related <em>stuff</em> that&#8217;d clutter up the lounge room area. I also like the idea of totally concentrating on getting things done when in the office and using a laptop outside or on the couch for more &#8220;recreational&#8221; computing.</p>



<p>Basically it&#8217;s the same plan with additional storage and garage space.</p>



<p><strong>Production Notes</strong></p>



<p>Again <a href="http://static.jimwhimpey.com/images/idealhouseplan2.svg">I&#8217;m offering the SVG file</a> to aid others creating floor plans in their favourite vector editor. I&#8217;ve found applications like <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/OmniGraffle/">OminGraffle</a>, which should be perfect for things like this, dumb it down to the point where it hinders doing simple things.</p>

	        <h2 class="entry-title">Selling</h2>
	      
			
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have zero concept of sentimental value and no hoarding instinct. I like to sell the things  I don&#8217;t use any more. Recently I&#8217;ve been trying to sell an old Dell screen and a USB microphone.</p>



<p>I started at <a href="http://gumtree.com.au/">Gumtree</a> (Australia&#8217;s Craigslist (although Craigslist does cover Australia (it&#8217;s just not very popular (which is vital to these sites usefulness)))) for two reasons.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s easier, list the item for free, interested parties inquire, if they want it they come and get it in exchange for cash. Very little time investment and minimal fucking around. I also like the concept of <em>real life</em> community a site like Gumtree fosters. More people should look locally for more things.</p>



<p>Both items were on Gumtree for a month with nothing but bullshit, time wasting, substance-less enquiries. I must have had 20 &#8220;is it still for sale?&#8221; emails. Of course it&#8217;s still for sale, that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s still listed under the fucking For Sale section of Gumtree. It&#8217;s like going to a supermarket and asking if those bananas are for sale.</p>



<p>I told each person that yes, it&#8217;s still for sale with not a single follow up. It&#8217;s like they were only curious if it was still for sale, not at all interested in actually buying anything.</p>



<p>There were a number of people asking where they could pick it up, I told them, they didn&#8217;t follow up. One guy arranged to meet me and never showed, when he finally answered my call half an hour after we were supposed to meet he made up some blubbering excuse and tried to organise another meet up. No.</p>



<p>Each week I&#8217;d lower the price â€” well below offers that&#8217;d previously been made with no follow up â€” there was no change in the response.</p>



<p>In an ideal world Gumtree is <em>the</em> place for getting rid of your stuff to people genuinely interested. In reality it&#8217;s 99% tyre kickers more interested in your time than what you&#8217;ve got to sell.</p>



<p>Fed up, I list them both on Ebay with a opening price and offer nationwide shipping. Bidding activity is strong, they sell at a price I&#8217;m happy with, the buyer pays immediately, the next day I ship them both at the expense of the buyer.</p>



<p>It cost me $8 and the hassle of shipping but was 100 times easier than entertaining the deluge of bullshit Gumtree inquiries.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I <em>know</em> it&#8217;s obvious what&#8217;s wrong with this but I can&#8217;t help but talk about it, I&#8217;m <em>facinated</em>.</p>



<p>As a customer this would do nothing but annoy me. You&#8217;re trying to buy a computer and every member of the <em>huge</em> staff breaks out into a repetitive dance for <em>4 minutes</em>. I understand a computer is a big purchase but imagine trying to buy a sandwich and having the cashier dance for even <em>10 seconds</em>. It would be maddening, in both situations.</p>



<p>Speed and service are the qualities I appreciate in a retail store. Microsoft is trying to be fun, a quality no one cares about when buying things (and which Microsoft fails to achieve with their embarrassing dance <em>anyway</em>), at the expense of both.</p>



<p>From what I can see, Microsoft spends 5% of it&#8217;s resources developing a shitty operating system and the remaining 95% on ill conceived ideas to convince people to buy it anyway.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve said similar things <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/194962900">before</a>. Even if Windows seemed like a decent piece of software, I would be wary of it knowing that the <em>same company</em> thinks pulling ridiculous shit like Windows 7 launch parties and dance routines in its stores are a good idea.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: This post includes an embedded table which lacks styles when viewed in the dashboard but which I&#8217;ve meticulously styled for <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/244183453">the post when viewed on the website</a>, I suggest you view it there.</em></p>



<p>I&#8217;m obsessed with the ideal setup. I try to milk the best out of the equipment I have and think a lot about how it could be improved as my situation changes and new technology is released.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve been more than satisfied with my 24&#8221; iMac at home for a long time but I feel like I&#8217;ve <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/194075509">outgrown it</a>. The Mac Pro was the next, extremely expensive, logical step. Until the 27&#8221; iMac arrived:</p>

</tr></table><p>Equivalent CPU power and (I guess) video cards, the iMac wins on RAM and hard disk space which are both cheap enough to be negligible. So as far as computer specifications go, they&#8217;re <em>very</em> similar, if not totally equivalent out of the box.</p>



<p>The iMac comes with a gorgeous, 27&#8221; LED backlit screen the likes of which you can&#8217;t even buy individually. The Mac Pro comes with no screen. The Mac Pro is expandable with PCI cards and hard disk slots. The cost of that expandability is $1900 and the best computer screen available.</p>



<p>For many the lack of expandability is a deal breaker. If expandability is not essential, the iMac is an easy choice and I imagine many Mac Pro users will defect to the iMac come upgrade time.</p>



<p>Expandability is not essential for me but it&#8217;s desirable. Evidently Apple is able to sell a computer with the power of the Mac Pro for much less than $4,499. I wish they&#8217;d put it in the Mac Pro&#8217;s expandable case and sell it at or below the iMac&#8217;s fantastic price.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><img src="/assets/tumblr/tumblr_kt3mqvgTDG1qzwfbio1_500.jpg"/><br/><p>After seeing the irresistible <a href="http://movies.apple.com/movies/wb/watchmen/watchmen-tlr2_720p.mov">Watchmen trailer (720p .mov)</a> I saw the movie soon after it was released in cinemas. It didn&#8217;t live up to my extremely high expectations but that&#8217;s not to say I didn&#8217;t enjoy it.</p>



<p>Still, every so often I go back to the trailer and want to see the movie again. A friend from work lent me the novel and I loved it, much more than I remember enjoying the movie.</p>



<p>Today I watched the movie again. I had a greater appreciation and better understanding having seen it once before and read the novel but it still didn&#8217;t live up to its potential. Watchmen is an intricate and complex story, the movie leaves a significant amount of that out, which is definitely fine but it then adds fat elsewhere.</p>



<p>One thing the movie did get right is the opening credits. In five minutes it completely covers the background story in a series of gorgeous slow motion scenes. It&#8217;s beautifully succinct in a way the rest of the movie is not.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s <a href="http://static.jimwhimpey.com/images/rorschach.jpg">another great still from the sequence</a> and I&#8217;ve cut <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0VmXfGHG_A">an HD version of the opening credits</a> at YouTube.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have avoided <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a> for <em>so</em> long. It reeks of people who think schmoozing and fortnightly &#8220;networking breakfasts&#8221; are the way to the top, a culture I actively avoid.</p>



<p>This afternoon it was the only search result for a person I was looking for. On their LinkedIn profile was a contact link. Contacting someone requires an account.</p>



<p>Already annoying but this is my only option. I resolve to sign up, email them and close my account. Signing up is a long, multiple step process that involves email activation. After logging in I have to skip my way through a number of information harvesting, data entry screens.</p>



<p>I find the guy I&#8217;m after and look for his email address. Not an option. I can send an &#8220;InMail&#8221;. I try to send an &#8220;InMail&#8221;. Not an option, to send an InMail I need to <strong>upgrade my account</strong>.</p>



<p>For the low price of $25/month I can send 3 &#8220;InMails&#8221;.</p>



<p>No. Fucking. Way.</p>



<p>I delete my account. My avoidance was well founded.</p>



<p>Please, everyone, buy <em>yourname</em>.com, put your email address on it and stop bullshit like LinkedIn dominating a search for your name. It&#8217;s bad for you, bad for people looking for you and good for the scumbags at LinkedIn.</p>

It requires three things:</p>



<ol><li>A jail broken phone.</li>

<li>OpenSSH installed, not a default on most jail broken phones.</li>

<li>The default root password.</li>

</ol><p>So about 0.1% of iPhones whose users have gone out of their way to open up completely but haven&#8217;t taken the care to change their password are susceptible. Meanwhile every iPhone owner is under the impression their phones are vulnerable.</p>



<p>Don&#8217;t let the truth get in the way of a good story. Not that anyone having their iPhone background set to a picture of Rick Astley is a good story.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I love the use of diagrams to present information. For humour, to make a point, factually precise or a general approximation, I love it. <a href="http://thisisindexed.com/">Indexed</a> is one my favourite websites.</p>



<p>So <a href="http://venndiagrams.tumblr.com/">Fuck Yeah Venn Diagrams</a> was an instant follow. But I&#8217;ve quickly been disappointed. There&#8217;s little clever distillation of information into graph form and a lot of forcing anything at all into a couple of circles.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The wallpaper featured on Simple Desktops is good but I&#8217;d never use it or feature it on <a href="http://solidbase.tumblr.com/">A Solid Base</a>. I love the simplicity but I don&#8217;t like solid colours, hard lines or a single focal point, ironically or not, I find it all distracting.</p>

Consistent, high quality photographs, prices on everything and no pagination makes it easy to compare their range.</p>



<p>Their products on the other hand don&#8217;t appeal to me at all.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><img src="/assets/tumblr/tumblr_ksoojaPzti1qzwfbio1_500.png"/><br/><p>Forum software is a cesspool of bloat and terrible, complicated UI design. For many niches interacting with forum software is the only option. There&#8217;s few easier ways to start a community. There&#8217;s 1000s of options, all trying to out feature the next when less, much less, is what&#8217;s desperately required.</p>



<p>The less phpBBs, Agoras, Simple Machines (the world&#8217;s most ironically named piece of software) and the more <a href="http://vanillaforums.org/">Vanillas</a> the better.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m consistently intrigued by people&#8217;s reluctance to spend money on iPhone applications. People who&#8217;ll lay down $6 on a beer or coffee without blinking wouldn&#8217;t dream of spending $2.50 on an iPhone app.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not because of a disinterest in applications, the phones their paying $2000+ for over two years are packed with apps, free apps. A strange phenomenon.</p>

<blockquote><p>Iâ€™m usually pretty bad about remembering to empty the Trash, but I think this is a personal record.</p></blockquote>



<p>I&#8217;m the opposite. Sometimes I&#8217;m so quick to right click the trash, ready to empty, after I&#8217;ve dropped something in it that it hasn&#8217;t registered yet and Empty Trash is still a greyed out option.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Is there anyone out there tech savvy or nerdy enough to be aware of and willing to buy a separate, additional <a href="http://www.amazon.com/iPhone-Missing-Manual-David-Pogue/dp/0596513747">Missing Manual for iPhone</a> but not tech savvy enough to simply play with the phone or browse the web to learn what it can do?</p>



<p>People who need a manual don&#8217;t care enough to buy an additional book meticulously explaining their device&#8217;s feature set.</p>



<p>And people who do want to know their device inside out can easily learn it themselves.</p>



<p>Who are these missing manual books for?</p>
