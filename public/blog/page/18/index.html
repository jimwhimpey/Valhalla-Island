  <div class="entry-content"><img src="/assets/tumblr/tumblr_kt3mqvgTDG1qzwfbio1_500.jpg"/><br/><p>After seeing the irresistible <a href="http://movies.apple.com/movies/wb/watchmen/watchmen-tlr2_720p.mov">Watchmen trailer (720p .mov)</a> I saw the movie soon after it was released in cinemas. It didn&#8217;t live up to my extremely high expectations but that&#8217;s not to say I didn&#8217;t enjoy it.</p>



<p>Still, every so often I go back to the trailer and want to see the movie again. A friend from work lent me the novel and I loved it, much more than I remember enjoying the movie.</p>



<p>Today I watched the movie again. I had a greater appreciation and better understanding having seen it once before and read the novel but it still didn&#8217;t live up to its potential. Watchmen is an intricate and complex story, the movie leaves a significant amount of that out, which is definitely fine but it then adds fat elsewhere.</p>



<p>One thing the movie did get right is the opening credits. In five minutes it completely covers the background story in a series of gorgeous slow motion scenes. It&#8217;s beautifully succinct in a way the rest of the movie is not.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s <a href="http://static.jimwhimpey.com/images/rorschach.jpg">another great still from the sequence</a> and I&#8217;ve cut <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0VmXfGHG_A">an HD version of the opening credits</a> at YouTube.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have avoided <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a> for <em>so</em> long. It reeks of people who think schmoozing and fortnightly &#8220;networking breakfasts&#8221; are the way to the top, a culture I actively avoid.</p>



<p>This afternoon it was the only search result for a person I was looking for. On their LinkedIn profile was a contact link. Contacting someone requires an account.</p>



<p>Already annoying but this is my only option. I resolve to sign up, email them and close my account. Signing up is a long, multiple step process that involves email activation. After logging in I have to skip my way through a number of information harvesting, data entry screens.</p>



<p>I find the guy I&#8217;m after and look for his email address. Not an option. I can send an &#8220;InMail&#8221;. I try to send an &#8220;InMail&#8221;. Not an option, to send an InMail I need to <strong>upgrade my account</strong>.</p>



<p>For the low price of $25/month I can send 3 &#8220;InMails&#8221;.</p>



<p>No. Fucking. Way.</p>



<p>I delete my account. My avoidance was well founded.</p>



<p>Please, everyone, buy <em>yourname</em>.com, put your email address on it and stop bullshit like LinkedIn dominating a search for your name. It&#8217;s bad for you, bad for people looking for you and good for the scumbags at LinkedIn.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I couldn&#8217;t believe it this morning watching 7 Early News that <a href="http://www.forbes.com/2009/11/08/iphone-virus-attack-technology-security-rickrolling-cybersecurity.html">this</a> was being reported as an iPhone virus with no more qualification than that. It requires three things:</p>



<ol><li>A jail broken phone.</li>

<li>OpenSSH installed, not a default on most jail broken phones.</li>

<li>The default root password.</li>

</ol><p>So about 0.1% of iPhones whose users have gone out of their way to open up completely but haven&#8217;t taken the care to change their password are susceptible. Meanwhile every iPhone owner is under the impression their phones are vulnerable.</p>



<p>Don&#8217;t let the truth get in the way of a good story. Not that anyone having their iPhone background set to a picture of Rick Astley is a good story.</p>

	        <h2 class="entry-title">Second Hand</h2>
	      
			
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>At work we have very short, golf-green-like carpet, a putting machine and a broken putter. I went to <a href="http://www.cashconverters.com.au/">Cash Converters</a>, one of Australia&#8217;s second hand store chain to buy a replacement club. My only requirement was that it be functional, my budget was roughly $10.</p>



<p>As second hand stores do, they had many putters. About 15 of them and not one was on sale for less than $40 despite most looking very crappy and very used, exactly what I was after.</p>



<p>I looked around the store, a rack of DVDs, a couple of guitars, a cabinet of jewellery, 4 staff and no customers — it was sparse. Meanwhile every story I&#8217;ve heard is that Cash Converters brutally low balls on everything you try to sell them.</p>



<p>Sites like Craigslist, Gumtree, The Trading Post and Ebay are evidence there is a massive market for second hand goods. Yet Cash Converters, what should be the physical manifestation of these websites, stagnates with barely any stock and ridiculously high prices.</p>



<p>If they were willing to reduce their margins Cash Converters would make a great place. I&#8217;m perpetually unloading stuff I don&#8217;t use anymore, I&#8217;d love a place I could take it all at once and get a fair price, albeit a lower price than I&#8217;d get with the hassle of listing it, fielding enquiries and shipping it myself. As a consumer I&#8217;d love a place I could go to get something inconsequential like a putter for cheap. It feels like a huge missed opportunity.</p>

	        <h2 class="entry-title">Streaming HD video from your Mac to your Xbox 360</h2>
	      
			
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have HD video on my computer. I have an Xbox 360 capable of playing video connected to my HDTV. I even have an <a href="http://www.nullriver.com/products/connect360">application</a> that will stream video from my computer to my Xbox over a local network. You&#8217;d think getting HD video to stream from your computer to your Xbox would be easy. It&#8217;s not and I&#8217;m loathed to spend money on another device. I&#8217;ve spent this last weekend trying to make it happen. I found a process that&#8217;s not ideal but it&#8217;ll do.</p>



<h3>The Problem</h3>



<ul><li>The Xbox will not play video in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matroska">Matroska</a> container, the most common format for HD video distribution.</li>

<li>MKV video can be converted to a format the Xbox can read but it can take days of computing power and produce massive files.</li>

<li>Transferring files via physical hard disk is slow and a pain in the ass.</li>

</ul><h3>The Good News</h3>



<p>The Xbox can play H264 video, which is the format of the video inside the Matroska container, it&#8217;s the audio format that the Xbox doesn&#8217;t like. Using Quicktime we&#8217;re able to pass through the video, convert the audio to something the Xbox likes and package it up in an MPEG-4 container. The video is identical, the file size equivalent and the process only takes 10–15 minutes.</p>



<h3>How It&#8217;s Done</h3>



<ol><li>Open the MKV video in QuickTime Pro 7. QuickTime X will not do it (exactly why requires a <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/reviews/2009/08/mac-os-x-10-6.ars/16">long, detailed explanation</a>).</li>

<li>Let the loading bar totally buffer, it takes 5-10 minutes.</li>

<li>File → Export</li>

<li>Choose Movie to MPEG-4 in the drop down.</li>

<li>Click Options.</li>

<li>Choose MP4 from the File Format drop down, <em>not</em> MP4 (ISMA).</li>

<li>Choose Pass Through from the Video Format drop down. If Pass Through is greyed out go back to the video, Window → Show Movie Properties, and deselect the subtitles channel. Try again.</li>

<li>On the Audio tab choose AAC-LC (Music) from the Audio Format drop down. Fill the rest with whatever you like, I use 160kbps, Mono, 44.100khz and &#8220;Best&#8221;.</li>

<li>Click OK, export the file.</li>

<li>It should take 10–15 minutes depending on your processor power, if it&#8217;s taking hours you&#8217;re converting the video too and doing it wrong.</li>

</ol><h3>The Bad News</h3>



<p>The Xbox refuses to play any file too big. Too big seems weigh in at something around 4GB but I&#8217;ve managed to play files a little larger than 4GB. The totally useless error message the Xbox displays when it refuses to play these files makes it seem your video is in the wrong format, it&#8217;s not, cut the video a little shorter and it plays fine.</p>



<p>To get around this insane limitation I&#8217;ve had success using <a href="http://likelysoft.com/splitfuse/">SplitFuse</a> to break a movie up into two, less-than-4GB parts. It takes another 5 or 10 minutes and is another step in the already too long chain but it works.</p>



<h3>Notes</h3>



<p>Steady playback is very hit or miss for me. Sometimes I&#8217;ll go an hour with no hiccups, other times video won&#8217;t play 20 seconds without stalling. Pausing for a time seems to help but not always. I am streaming with an ordinary router over the G protocol between rooms, so the connection is far from the fastest a local network could be. I&#8217;m sure playback would be much more reliable through an Airport Extreme or a wired network.</p>



<p>The process is long, impossible to automate and no where near as convenient or reliable as downloading iTunes content to an Apple TV. But you already have a device capable of playing HD content through your TV and the result at the end of it all is fantastic.</p>

<p>I admire Girl Talk&#8217;s ability to take two original songs I don&#8217;t like and merge them into one song I like a lot. This is my favourite part from <a href="http://74.124.198.47/illegal-art.net/__girl__talk___feed__the__anima.ls___/">Feed the Animals</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Four and a half years ago John Gruber <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2005/06/shuffling">wrote</a>:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Remember: every decision you force a customer to make is another chance for them to decide to just walk away.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>That resonated with me then was clearly demonstrated to me this week.</p>



<p>Two days ago I was <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/217965736">obviously excited</a> about  the new internationally available Amazon Kindle. I&#8217;d wanted one for a long time but it&#8217;s only now a possibility. Buying one was only a matter of having enough spare cash.</p>



<p>Enter the <a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/nook/index.asp">Nook</a>.</p>



<p>Is it better than the Kindle? It&#8217;s not as well established, the Kindle&#8217;s already had many great reviews but maybe the Nook has learnt from the few issues people have with the Kindle? It has a touch screen colour LCD and virtual keyboard, is that better than the Kindle&#8217;s equivalent? Is wifi important? Does Barnes &amp; Noble have the same range of books at similar prices? Are they better prices? How does battery life compare? Is it insignificant when both devices have such long battery life? Is the ability to share important to me? If it&#8217;s important is it even practical?</p>



<p>What two days ago was a sure thing is now a mountain of questions and I&#8217;m weighed down by the burden to decide.</p>



<p>So I consolidate the questions down to one: do I need an eBook reader at all?</p>



<p>No.</p>



<p>Burden relieved.</p>
