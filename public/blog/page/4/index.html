  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Preface: I&#8217;ve never used <a href="http://gowalla.com/">Gowalla</a> but apparently it&#8217;s a better foursquare (which I also haven&#8217;t used and <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/jimwhimpey/status/138885690032271360">don&#8217;t get</a>).</p>



<p>Anyway, they got <a href="http://blog.gowalla.com/post/13782997303/gowalla-going-to-facebook">bought by Facebook</a> just the other day. MG Siegler <a href="http://parislemon.com/post/13659256377/facebook-buys-gowalla">said</a>:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>I’m really happy for the Gowalla team.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>This <a href="http://twitter.com/wilshipley/status/143851541697265666">seems to be</a> the vibe whenever one of these small companies gets bought by a big company. I say &#8220;vibe&#8221; because I avoid actually following this kind of news and only see reaction to it on Twitter.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;ve started a small company, working with great people (which I would assume because you&#8217;ve hired them), making something great that lots of people enjoy and you&#8217;re making money I can&#8217;t see how getting bought by a huge company would be anything to be happy about.</p>



<p>But I guess that&#8217;s the classic (and ridiculous) problem for these kinds of startups: everything&#8217;s great except they&#8217;re not making money, they have no plan to make money and that can&#8217;t possibly be sustained. I&#8217;d imagine Gowalla would have much preferred to find a way to make money themselves. It&#8217;s bizarre that people would be happy for and congratulate a company for doing the only alternative to eventual bankruptcy at the expense of all their control and identity.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure looking back in 30 years, long after gay marriage is made federal law and becomes commonplace, as always eventually happens with issues of equality, Helen Polley will be comfortable with the grave concern she showed for <em>votes</em>.</p>

	        <h2 class="entry-title">Overworking Culture</h2>
	      
			
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>In a typical case of assholery, Mike Arrington misappropriated Jamie Zawinski&#8217;s comments from over 15 years ago to support his gross, self-serving argument for startup employees <a href="http://uncrunched.com/2011/11/27/startups-are-hard-so-work-more-cry-less-and-quit-all-the-whining/">working themselves into the ground</a>.</p>



<p>Delightfully, Jamie <a href="http://www.jwz.org/blog/2011/11/watch-a-vc-use-my-name-to-sell-a-con/">responded</a>:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>What <em>is</em> true is that for a VC&#8217;s business model to work, it&#8217;s necessary for you to give up <em>your</em> life in order for <em>him</em> to become richer.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>At the end of Arrington&#8217;s diatribe he links to <a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/11/27/zyngas-tough-culture-risks-a-talent-drain/">this NY Times post</a> titled, Zynga’s Tough Culture Risks a Talent Drain with the comment: &#8220;FFS, the place has free acupuncture and an organic cafeteria&#8221; as though that somehow makes up for&#8230; urgh, I can&#8217;t even respond.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve never used any of Zynga&#8217;s stuff so I can&#8217;t comment on the result first hand but I think the fourth comment on that article unintentionally summarises the situation beautifully:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Zynga&#8217;s software is terrible. Their programmers don&#8217;t deserve their stock options. How is it possible that all those hard charging long hours add up to the most dysfunctional experience on the internet?</p>

</blockquote>



<p><em>Good question</em>.</p>



<p>The answer is that a quality result not only has little to do with <em>raw hours</em> but is often inversely proportional to the amount of hours spent on something beyond what allows a balanced life. The currency of a developer is brain <em>power</em>, not brain time. The kind of conditions Arrington is advocating is like suggesting a terrible song would be much more popular if only it went for twice as long.</p>

	        <h2 class="entry-title">The Steve Jobs Biography</h2>
	      
			
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Previously I only knew vague details of Apple&#8217;s history so I learnt a great deal. Steve Jobs was truly and genius and his life is inspirational to me beyond words. I share many of values in almost all areas but don&#8217;t live them with anywhere near the same extreme conviction. The book has inspired me to live with more. It also further instilled the value of focus, <em>laser beam focus</em>.</p>



<p>Yes, he was a jerk but it&#8217;s been to the <em>benefit of humanity</em>. Shit work walks out the door every day because feelings can&#8217;t be hurt or diplomacy needs to be maintained. This is a terrible tradeoff. If more shit was called as it is the world would be a better place.</p>



<p>The details of the Sculley saga are bizarre with the way Jobs completely manipulated him to his own detriment. At least in the short to medium term. I doubt everything that happened with Sculley negatively affected the long term. Perhaps it was even a net positive but what a strange story.</p>



<p>As I was reading I used the Kindle&#8217;s great highlights feature to select my favourite quotes:</p>



<blockquote>A few weeks later he called Bob Belleville, one of the hardware designers on the Xerox Star team. “Everything you’ve ever done in your life is shit,” Jobs said, “so why don’t you come work for me?” Belleville did, and so did Larry Tesler.</blockquote>



<blockquote>“The goal was never to beat the competition, or to make a lot of money. It was to do the greatest thing possible, or even a little greater.” (Andy Hertzfeld)</blockquote>



<blockquote>At one point Kare and Atkinson complained that he was making them spend too much time on tiny little tweaks to the title bar when they had bigger things to do. Jobs erupted. “Can you imagine looking at that every day?” he shouted. “It’s not just a little thing, it’s something we have to do right.”</blockquote>



<blockquote>After the confrontation in the conference room, Gates quietly gave Jobs a private demo of what was being planned for Windows. “Steve didn’t know what to say,” Gates recalled. “He could either say, ‘Oh, this is a violation of something,’ but he didn’t. He chose to say, ‘Oh, it’s actually really a piece of shit.’”</blockquote>



<blockquote>When Jobs asked for a number of options to consider, Rand declared that he did not create different options for clients. “I will solve your problem, and you will pay me,” he told Jobs. “You can use what I produce, or not, but I will not do options, and either way you will pay me.”</blockquote>



<blockquote>“So I asked Issey to make me some of his black turtlenecks that I liked, and he made me like a hundred of them.” Jobs noticed my surprise when he told this story, so he gestured to them stacked up in the closet. “That’s what I wear,” he said. “I have enough to last for the rest of my life.”</blockquote>



<blockquote>People don’t know what they want until you show it to them. That’s why I never rely on market research.</blockquote>



<p>After finishing the book I have an even greater respect for Jobs, a deeper sadness that he died young and less faith that a Jobs-less Apple will continue to make things I love to use every day.</p>

Something about this show really hit the spot for me, as it did for a lot of people and as no other TV show or movie has since.</p>



<p>So I&#8217;ve started watching it again from the beginning with Anne, who hasn&#8217;t seen a single episode.</p>



<p>I knew there&#8217;d be many extra things I&#8217;d pick up on having already been through the series once but there was a beautiful moment in season 1, episode 2 when Locke is teaching backgammon to Walt. He holds up the pieces and explains, &#8220;two sides, one is light, one is dark&#8221; followed by a long pause. This would become the theme through the next 100 episodes.</p>

<p>One of the bridesmaids at the wedding reception I was at last night was flying home to the US at 11am the next day. At around 11pm she found out <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-10-29/qantas-locking-out-staff/3608250">Alan Joyce ordered the grounding of Qantas&#8217; entire fleet</a>. By around 1am, after furious back and forth on the phone at her best friend&#8217;s wedding, she&#8217;d organised an alternative flight on Virgin that left in just 5 hours.</p>



<p>This is what Joyce has chosen to do to 10s of 1000s of passengers instead of keeping Australia&#8217;s airline jobs <em>in Australia</em> and paying workers like pilots and engineers, who are responsible for people&#8217;s safety, what they&#8217;re worth. Refusing to even negotiate with the unions has already cost Qantas a huge portion of what the unions&#8217; demands would cost, and that&#8217;s not to mention the 1000s of customers plans thrown into disarray. Grounding the whole fleet is costing $20m <em>each day</em> while destroying <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-10-30/irate-passengers-vow-to-abandon-qantas/3608640">Qantas&#8217; reputation</a>.</p>



<p>Alan Kohler opened with a great question on <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-10-30/joyce-defends-qantas-grounding/3608780">Inside Business this morning</a>:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Alan Joyce, you said yesterday that the industrial action was killing Qantas slowly, have you decided to kill it quickly instead?</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Meanwhile, just two days ago, <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-10-28/qantas-shareholders-vote-in-favour-of-pay-rise-for/3607222?section=business">shareholders inexplicably voted to give Joyce at 70% pay rise to $5m</a>. The absurdity of this situation is mind boggling. <a href="http://www.facebook.com/Qantas">There&#8217;s a new spirit</a> indeed, a spirit of fucking people over.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://chrispiascik.com/daily-drawings/millionaires/"><img src="/assets/tumblr/tumblr_ltchgkI0uw1qzoljso1_500.jpg"/></a></p><p>So the American government is greedy and corrupt at the expense of the American people. I believe that and whole-heartedly support the Occupy Wall Street protests. But this comparison is dumb.</p>



<p>The annual salary of a US congressperson is between <a href="http://usgovinfo.about.com/od/uscongress/a/congresspay.htm">$175 and $193k</a>, <em>of course</em> they&#8217;re more likely to be millionaires. Making this comparison is like pointing out that there&#8217;s way more relative millionaire <em>dentists</em> than there are in the general population.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know the context of this quote but it was running though my mind as I was climbing a 5km 15% mountain, on my own, at sunset, two thirds of the way though a <a href="http://app.strava.com/rides/1992352">235km ride</a> that&#8217;s left me suffering two days later.</p>
