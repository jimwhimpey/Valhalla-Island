  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is the worst infographic I have ever seen. There is almost no attempt to actually <em>visualise</em> anything. Even the pie charts are ridiculous, slices of the same conceptual pie are <em>shown in their own individual pies</em>! You&#8217;d digest this information more quickly and gain more insight by reading these numbers from a spreadsheet.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><img src="/assets/tumblr/tumblr_lun4p9nkSU1qzwfbio1_r1_500.png"/><br/><p>I don&#8217;t only remember Lost as being great entertainment but as being a great part of my life as I looked forward to it, watched it, talked about it and theorised with my friends. Something about this show really hit the spot for me, as it did for a lot of people and as no other TV show or movie has since.</p>



<p>So I&#8217;ve started watching it again from the beginning with Anne, who hasn&#8217;t seen a single episode.</p>



<p>I knew there&#8217;d be many extra things I&#8217;d pick up on having already been through the series once but there was a beautiful moment in season 1, episode 2 when Locke is teaching backgammon to Walt. He holds up the pieces and explains, &#8220;two sides, one is light, one is dark&#8221; followed by a long pause. This would become the theme through the next 100 episodes.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am pro union because I am pro people. Profits to a non-human legal entity at the expense of <em>actual people</em> (or safety, or a quality experience) is crazy and it blows my mind that any <em>person</em>  could think another way.</p>



<p>One of the bridesmaids at the wedding reception I was at last night was flying home to the US at 11am the next day. At around 11pm she found out <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-10-29/qantas-locking-out-staff/3608250">Alan Joyce ordered the grounding of Qantas&#8217; entire fleet</a>. By around 1am, after furious back and forth on the phone at her best friend&#8217;s wedding, she&#8217;d organised an alternative flight on Virgin that left in just 5 hours.</p>



<p>This is what Joyce has chosen to do to 10s of 1000s of passengers instead of keeping Australia&#8217;s airline jobs <em>in Australia</em> and paying workers like pilots and engineers, who are responsible for people&#8217;s safety, what they&#8217;re worth. Refusing to even negotiate with the unions has already cost Qantas a huge portion of what the unions&#8217; demands would cost, and that&#8217;s not to mention the 1000s of customers plans thrown into disarray. Grounding the whole fleet is costing $20m <em>each day</em> while destroying <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-10-30/irate-passengers-vow-to-abandon-qantas/3608640">Qantas&#8217; reputation</a>.</p>



<p>Alan Kohler opened with a great question on <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-10-30/joyce-defends-qantas-grounding/3608780">Inside Business this morning</a>:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Alan Joyce, you said yesterday that the industrial action was killing Qantas slowly, have you decided to kill it quickly instead?</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Meanwhile, just two days ago, <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-10-28/qantas-shareholders-vote-in-favour-of-pay-rise-for/3607222?section=business">shareholders inexplicably voted to give Joyce at 70% pay rise to $5m</a>. The absurdity of this situation is mind boggling. <a href="http://www.facebook.com/Qantas">There&#8217;s a new spirit</a> indeed, a spirit of fucking people over.</p>

	        <h2 class="entry-title">Helmets</h2>
	      
			
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is an argument that&#8217;s come up over and over again lately as more Australian cities implement public bike hire programs which are failing.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll state my position again: helmets <strong>should not</strong> be compulsory for adults. The kind of riding a casual cyclist commuting on a 30kg public bike does is <em>extremely low risk</em>. It&#8217;s clear helmets are a barrier to more people cycling while similar programs in helmet-less nations have flourished. The more people cycling, the more demand for cycling infrastructure, the more aware and accepting motorists will be of cyclists and the safer cycling becomes for everyone. It&#8217;s simple.</p>



<p>Because I am a glutton for punishment, I read the comments on <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/sport/cycling/blogs/cycling-tips/change-of-tune-20110817-1iwx4.html">articles like this one</a> from Wade Wallace and there are two arguments that infuriate me the most.</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Yes, the bicycles are the sturdy sit-up and beg type, but they are still vulnerable to what you call the biggest threat: traffic. Well, that&#8217;s why I always put my helmet on.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Are we so accustomed to the nanny state that someone would be against a law being repealed because they currently adhere to the law as it makes them feel personally safer? <em>Repealing the law doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;re not allowed to wear a helmet if you want to</em>! Many people would still wear helmets, I would still wear a helmet 99% of the time. Ahh!</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Cycle deaths in Australia are numbered each year in the 100s, in the U.K. they number in the 1000s (and are apparently in the increase). Cycle helmets save lives (lots and lots of them) - simple as that.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>That is not the argument. <em>No one</em> is arguing that you&#8217;re less likely to die in a crash if you&#8217;re not wearing a helmet. The argument is that the net safety gain of having many more bikes and less cars on the road, net general health gains of having more people more active and net environmental and societal gains from quiet, safer, zero emission transportation <em>far</em> outweighs the benefit of having a helmet on by law in bike accident situations which, even if the law was repealed, people would be wearing helmets in <em>anyway</em>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This story seems to me like an incredibly obvious case of missing the point. There is nothing inherent about watching coloured pixels flicker that would cause ill-effects to your health.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s far more likely that sitting for long periods is a problem in which case the fact a TV is on in your line of sight makes no difference. Reading a book or listening to a podcast on the couch would produce the same results. It&#8217;s also likely that high amounts of TV watching is an indicator of less time spent exercising or cooking fresh, healthy meals.</p>



<p>Their conclusion is the equivalent of claiming spending time inside a McDonalds restaurant directly relates to the purchase of plus size clothing.</p>

  <p>This is the feature I&#8217;m most looking forward to in <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/whats-new/features.html">Lion</a>. Many times a day I go through the process of typing a sentence, seeing the red underline on a word, switching to the mouse, right clicking, selecting the first correct spelling suggestion, moving back to the end of the sentence and continuing. I always wished you could access that contextual menu with just the keyboard but this Lion feature completely eliminates the need.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>I wrote that a few months ago, saved it as a draft and didn&#8217;t publish for some reason. A month into Lion and I can say that my anticipation was well-founded, I <em>love</em> auto correct in Lion. <a href="http://adium.im/">Adium</a> doesn&#8217;t yet support it and it&#8217;s hugely frustrating, I don&#8217;t know how I lived without it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Alex Steffen makes the eloquent case against simply using clean energy to solve our climate problem.</p>



<p>This explains why, even if electric cars were readily available and they could be charged on 100% clean energy I have very little interest in owning one despite not owning a car now partially for environmental reasons. I would much rather (and do) live close to the things I need and want to do. Electric or not, cars are backed up from my house to the city each morning. I pass hundreds of gridlocked cars on my 7 minute bike ride to work, they&#8217;re already unsustainable.</p>



<p>He ends with this great quote:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Because right now our economy by and large operates as Paul Hawkins said by stealing the future, selling it in the present and calling it GDP.</p>

<p>I shot my first one almost three years ago and was inspired by the My Day, Yesterday forefather, Garrett Murray <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/garrettmurray/5997136326/">doing it again</a>. Like last time, getting the footage was a real burden but editing it was a lot of fun.</p>
