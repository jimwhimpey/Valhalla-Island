  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://joe.hewitt.usesthis.com/">The Setup: Joe Hewitt</a></p><p>Firefox, Firebug and Facebook developer Joe Hewitt has my dream setup. An extremely powerful desktop running two massive screens in combination with a relatively low spec but small and portable laptop. Power and screen space where portability doesn&#8217;t matter and portability where power and screen space doesn&#8217;t matter. Perfectly complimentary.</p>



<p>I was running a junior version of this setup while at university. 24&#8221; iMac at home and 12&#8221; PowerBook out and about. It remains the best computer combination I&#8217;ve used. Now I&#8217;m in an awkward situation with a not-small laptop that&#8217;s more powerful than my desktop, I don&#8217;t like it but my requirements are unusual and my options are limited.</p>

	        <h2 class="entry-title">Forgetting Apple is supposed to suck, one iPhone at a time</h2>
	      
			
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001280.html">This post about the iPhone</a> from long time Windows developer and lover Jeff Atwood could not be more uncomfortable. Like an 8-year-old boy talking about the girl he has a crush on, he&#8217;s falling over himself trying to say good things about the iPhone without looking like he&#8217;s totally gay for Apple.</p>



<p>Jeff admits he hasn&#8217;t owned an Apple product for 25 years and that lack of experience with Macs is obvious:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>There&#8217;s always been a weird tension in Apple&#8217;s computer designs, because they attempt to control every nuance of the entire experience from end to end. For the best Apple™ experience, you run custom Apple™ applications on artfully designed Apple™ hardware dongles.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Apple&#8217;s hardware and software work great together with Apple&#8217;s peripherals, as a computer user that <em>reduces</em> the tension for me significantly.</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>All those things that bugged me about Apple&#8217;s computers are utter non-issues in the phone market. Proprietary handset? So is every other handset. Locked in to a single vendor? Everyone signs a multi-year contract. One company controlling your entire experience? That&#8217;s how it&#8217;s always been done.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Oh, so that weird tension Apple™ creates by only offering the best Apple™ experience with Apple™ hardware, Apple™ software and Apple™ peripherals doesn&#8217;t bother you at all in a market where <em>actually</em> being locked in by way of contract is the status quo. The same way I&#8217;m cool with treating women like dirt when I&#8217;m hanging out with my Saudi Arabian friends.</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Apple has never been particularly great at supporting software developers [&#8230;]</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Except when it comes to providing a full suite of developer tools with the operating system and offering developer connection subscriptions both completely free rather than <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-au/subscriptions/subscriptionschart.aspx">charging the 1000s of dollars Microsoft does</a>, yeah they&#8217;re not great at supporting developers.</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>If this has all come across as too rah-rah, too uncritical a view of the iPhone, I apologize. There are certainly things to be critical about, such as the App Store&#8217;s weird enforcement policies, the lack of support for emulators, or Flash, or anything else that might somehow undermine the platform as decided in some paranoid, secretive Apple back room. Not that we&#8217;d ever hear about it.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>God <em>forbid</em> you give an uncritical review of something you obviously love. Quick, ridicule Apple&#8217;s secretiveness, that&#8217;ll do. Lack of support for Flash or emulators couldn&#8217;t possibly be a trade-off to improve phone experience you&#8217;re currently lauding as a whole.</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>I didn&#8217;t write this to kiss Apple&#8217;s ass.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>You <em>didn&#8217;t</em>?! And here I was about to call you an Apple fanboi because there&#8217;s no way a phone could actually be <em>that good</em>. Up until now I thought your review must be based on unwavering loyalty to the Apple brand, not the phone&#8217;s merits.</p>



<p>This is a long standing dilemma for Mac users and lovers trying to communicate the virtues of the platform with Windows users. We use Macs because it&#8217;s a better, friction less experience, not because we&#8217;re married to Apple. I can only assume that it&#8217;s because they&#8217;re so tragically hardened by their long-standing, endless, multiple computer battle trying to force Windows to do what they want that they simply cannot believe or don&#8217;t want to believe (they&#8217;ve already invested SO. MUCH. TIME. ALREADY) that a computer exists without those problems that&#8217;s a joy to use.</p>



<p>On a greater scale than the iPod, the iPhone is going lure in a huge amount of non-Mac users. There&#8217;s little barrier to finding out what a joyful, easy experience it can be when a company that cares about user experience and good design creates a product, hardware, software, peripherals and from the ground up to work together. A lot of people, even curmudgeonly old Windows developers, will hang up their hang ups about being &#8220;forced&#8221; to buy a great computer to run great software and will enjoy the computer again just as they enjoy their new phones.</p>

<p>For the entire length of this song the crowd was silent. Not one person of the 200 strong crowd took advantage of the silence to yell something stupid or anything at all. Every note and every word rang out as if in a vacuum. It was a surreal moment.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the <a href="http://comedyandeverythingelse.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=493607">latest episode of Comedy and Everything Else</a> Patton Oswalt suggests movie theatres install headphone jacks under each seat so you can bring your own high quality headphones.

  <p>This seems to be a prevalent feeling. To most people, the computer is an annoying tool that they reluctantly use because their job requires it, and mobile phones are a way for their boss to reach them wherever they are, creating an expectation of constant availability for “working”.</p>

  

  <p>I’ve never viewed my connected technology this way. Yes, computers and phones are a way for me to be connected to my work. But they’re also my play, my hobby, my leisure, my education, my exposure to society, and my enlightenment. I like this connection.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>I feel exactly the same way as <a href="http://www.marco.org/50873688">Marco</a>. The attitude amongst most people I know is that the computer is an inherently bad thing. Sure it&#8217;s convenient to do some things and a requirement for others but at its core the computer is <em>bad</em> and must be excluded or avoided wherever possible. I can&#8217;t help but think it has something to do with the pain that is using Windows.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>From the <a href="http://shauninman.com/pact/">same dude</a> who makes the excellent <a href="http://haveamint.com/">Mint</a> website stats tool and designed around the same self hosted model. The self-hosted model works for Mint because needing it almost always means you&#8217;re already running similar software on your own server. For a standalone application like a feed reader I think it&#8217;s much less of a good idea. Even I, someone with experience in and totally comfortable with fucking around on a web server, don&#8217;t want to deal with the hassle of self-hosting an application. For anyone less technically equipped it could be a frustratingly difficult process to simply get it up and running.</p>



<p>Freeing myself of the burden of managing a self-hosted WordPress install was the number one reason I switched to Tumblr. I&#8217;ve been a much happier blogger ever since.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>My place of employment is a corporation with a deeply ingrained culture of using Microsoft products. When I started my job I had a temporary PC (until my permanent PC would arrive) and I tried using it. A few weeks in I brought in my disused first generation Macbook, connected it, setup my Exchange email account in Mail and I&#8217;ve been happily and efficiently working away ever since.</p>



<p>Now that Macbook&#8217;s lease is soon to end and I was hoping my employer would fund a Mac, rather than a PC, to replace it. This is an issue of contention. Both my boss and co-workers ask often &#8220;why can&#8217;t you just use Windows?&#8221; After using a PC for many years and now using Mac for many years the difference is crystal clear in my mind yet difficult to quantify and thus, difficult to communicate to people who&#8217;ve never experienced the difference.</p>



<p>Even <a href="http://www.marco.org/26335880">Marco</a>, while making good points brings it down to <em>design</em>, something very difficult quantify. What follows is a list of things you <em>can</em> quantify. It&#8217;s just a selection of features and functionality that ship with or are exclusive to OS X that make using a Mac more pleasant and productive.</p>



<p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotlight_(software)">Spotlight</a></strong>: I use Spotlight to launch apps, find files, notes, emails, people, do calculations and look up dictionary and thesaurus definitions. It&#8217;s instant and integrates perfectly with all applications, including third party applications. It&#8217;s Google for your own data but faster and more accurate.</p>



<p><strong><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/joewhk/3434632507/">Colour labels</a></strong>: I mark files that are currently relevant with red labels, personal projects with blue, old university stuff with purple. If I&#8217;m watching a series of TV shows I&#8217;ll label each one I&#8217;ve watched so I instantly know where I&#8217;m up to when I get back. It&#8217;s not a hack, they appear in every kind of file view, you can create smart folders using them as filters. It&#8217;s one simple solution to many small problems.</p>



<p><strong><a href="http://me.com">MobileMe</a></strong>: I turned on MobileMe (then .Mac) two years ago and it&#8217;s worked invisibly and flawlessly since. It&#8217;s a massively underrated service. I modify a contact&#8217;s details at home, the next day I go to work, it&#8217;s there. I find that contact on my phone, it&#8217;s there. I&#8217;m on a friend&#8217;s computer, I go online and it&#8217;s there. MobileMe is a classic case of having something just work with zero administration.</p>



<p><strong>The System Wide Dictionary</strong>: Across every native application, in every text field, area, control or any slab of text whatsoever, you get the same system wide spell checker and dictionary. You don&#8217;t need to be inside a word processor, spell checking exists the same way in a webpage&#8217;s text fields, your Twitter app, your instant message client, <em>everything</em>.</p>



<p>The system wide dictionary doesn&#8217;t just provide spell checking but hover your mouse over any word in any native application and hit command+option+d for an inline, contextual dictionary definition. The fact this functionality isn&#8217;t available in Air and Flash (because they&#8217;re not native) is one of the many frustrating things about using those applications.</p>



<p><strong><a href="http://archive.valhallaisland.com/blog/2008/dictionary-the-quintessential-mac-application/">The Dictionary Application</a></strong>: OS X ships with a beautiful application that interfaces with the New Oxford American Dictionary, Oxford American Writer&#8217;s Thesaurus, Apple&#8217;s own dictionary of terms and Wikipedia. The app works like a wiki with clicking any word taking you to the definition for that word with linear forward and back navigation. It&#8217;s gorgeously typeset and even <a href="http://archive.valhallaisland.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/picture-16.png">formats Wikipedia articles</a> into a paired-back, more readable format. Like so many other OS X applications, Dictionary also integrates with Spotlight. Every time I come across an unheard of word I I type it into Spotlight, hit enter and read the definition in Dictionary. I use it the same way for thesaurus references over and over again while composing blog posts, email messages and writing documents. (Already I&#8217;ve used it 6 times during this post alone). The time taken between wanting a definition or synonym and getting one is limited only by how fast you can type.</p>



<p><strong>The Command Line and other Unix Things</strong>: I&#8217;m not a huge command line user but having powerful, lower level control of your system is useful and empowering. No matter what an application might tell you, ultimately you&#8217;re in control. Accessing your computer and others remotely with ssh, interacting with tools like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_Ruby_Shell">irb</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launchd">launcd</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL">cURL</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wget">wget</a> and stringing them together with bash scripts can be a lifesaver in some situations, simply fun to play with in others. Otherwise complicated problems can be easily solved with lightweight scripting and the command line. There&#8217;s applications like <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> which are so conceptually complicated and difficult to visualise that text on a command line is simply the most clear and efficient method of interaction.</p>



<p>With the command line your entire system is totally at your disposal. Nothing&#8217;s hidden for your &#8220;safety&#8221; or your own good.</p>



<p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expos%C3%A9_(Mac_OS_X)">Exposé</a></strong>: I rarely used Exposé until I had to use a smaller screen at work, then it became invaluable. There&#8217;s simply no more intuitive method for managing many windows on a single screen.</p>



<p><strong>Drag and Drop</strong>: Just some examples. Drag a file onto an application in the dock and it opens in that application. Drag a snippet of text onto Safari and it performs a Google search with that string. Drag an MP3 onto iTunes and it&#8217;s added to the library. Drag multiple files or a folder onto TextMate and it creates a new project using those files. Drag a file onto Mail and it creates a new email with that file as an attachment. Drag a folder from the Finder into a Terminal window and it inserts the path to that folder. Dragging something but can&#8217;t see the window where you want to drop it? Start dragging, hit an Exposé key, drag it onto the window you want. If your drop destination isn&#8217;t in an open window drill down through folders by hovering until it opens, there&#8217;s no need to prepare windows ready for a drag.</p>



<p>The extent to which drag and drop is integrated into the system is staggering. It&#8217;s totally intuitive and saves a lot of time.</p>



<p><strong><a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/what-is-macosx/quick-look.html">Quick Look</a></strong>: Instantly review a file&#8217;s contents without having to sit through a slow application launch.</p>



<p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preview_(software)">Preview</a></strong>: An instantly launching image viewer and lightweight editor. I use Preview so I don&#8217;t have to open Fireworks or Photoshop to do a simple resize, crop or pick colours from an image. It has more advanced but less frequently used colour adjusting controls. It&#8217;s an app that ships with OS X you take for granted until you&#8217;re on a Windows machine left with MS Paint or the absurdly-named Windows Picture and Fax Viewer as options.</p>



<p><strong><a href="http://guides.macrumors.com/Taking_Screenshots_in_Mac_OS_X">Screenshots</a></strong>: Command+shift+3 takes a full screenshot, command+shift+4 allows you to select an area of the screen, command+shift+4 followed by the spacebar automatically snaps to windows for a clean single window screenshot with shadows. All output PNG files directly and immediately to the desktop, there&#8217;s no need for an image editor, no need for manual post-cropping and no need for exporting. Taking screenshots works how taking screenshots should work.</p>



<p><strong>Natural Language Recognition</strong>: If there&#8217;s anything that looks like a phone number or an address in a Mail.app email message it&#8217;s recognised as one and can be sent to Address Book. If there&#8217;s anything that looks like a date and time in a Mail.app email message it&#8217;s recognised as an event and can be sent to iCal. It&#8217;s something very simple but it saves having to manually transfer data between applications that a computer should be able to take care of.</p>



<p><strong>The Dock</strong>: Not just an application launcher or drag target but a notifier, application controller and organiser. Unread messages, file transfer progress, completed downloads, new instant messages, know what applications are open all at a glance from the Dock. Control applications without having to show the app&#8217;s window. Put anything in there you want quick access to: files, folders or web bookmarks without sullying your desktop.</p>



<p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automator_(software)">Automator</a></strong>: Automator makes repetitive tasks easy to farm out to your computer, who&#8217;s much better at them. Need to crop a bunch of images with the same dimensions? Rename a set of files based on a find and replace? Or extract the text from multiple PDFs? Automator can do it for you.</p>



<p><strong><a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/what-is-macosx/time-machine.html">Time Machine</a></strong>: Backup both a chore and important. I don&#8217;t want to setup backup processes, I don&#8217;t want to have to make sure it works, I don&#8217;t want to have to go through a three hour roll back restore process to get an old version of a file. Until you need it, Time Machine is invisible, when you do need it the process of restoring files is quick, simple and totally painless. It&#8217;s how backup should work.</p>



<p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DigitalColor_Meter">DigitalColor Meter</a></strong>: Pick colours from anything on the screen, hit a shortcut to copy the value to the clipboard. Very few applications have a colour picker built in (and so they shouldn&#8217;t) so a tool that transcends applications and the operating system makes sense. DigitalColor Meter does its sole job so well I&#8217;ll often still use it to pick colours from graphics applications that have their own picker built in.</p>



<p>These are just a few of the tangible parts that make using a computer running OS X a joy. Not because interacting with the OS is a joy but because the OS <em>does it&#8217;s job</em>, letting you spend your time on what you really want to be doing. This is before taking into account the much more important but difficult to quantify experience as a whole. When these great tools and features come together with a consistent, seamless and clearly thought out design the advantage is amplified. Mac OS X is greater than the sum of it&#8217;s parts but even the parts make a pretty good case on their own.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><img src="/assets/tumblr/oaQecruTZoxit7ryFlCATNEoo1_500.jpg"/><br/><p>Laundry instructions are <em>always</em> excessively strict. Almost all my clothes tell me to wash in cold water, spin slowly, don&#8217;t mix colours and never tumble dry. In the case of my running and cycling gear it&#8217;s hand wash and drip dry <em>only</em>. I&#8217;ve ignored all those instructions for years and my clothes aren&#8217;t ruined and their colours have never run.</p>

The top grab is from the refurb store, the bottom from the standard store both taken today. The previous version of an almost identically specced Macbook Pro is selling second hand (albeit refurbed) for $600&#160;<em>more</em> than a brand new one and that&#8217;s <em>with a $500 discount</em>! The latest model also sports a much better battery and an SD card slot.</p>



<p>Macbook Pros have gone from incredibly overpriced to very reasonably priced since WWDC. I have a feeling Apple will have a tough time moving that computer from the refurb store.</p>
