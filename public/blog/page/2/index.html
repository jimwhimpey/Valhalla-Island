	        <h2 class="entry-title">Minor Differences Between Australia and France</h2>
	      
			
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been in France for over a month now staying in Grenoble while <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jimwhimpey/">riding my bike through the French alps</a>. In my time here I&#8217;ve noticed a lot of small differences between our countries and cultures. These kind of differences and the circumstances that brought them about fascinates me.</p>

<h3>Cars and Driving</h3>

<p>90% of cars are hatchbacks, the other 10% are vans. I have seen one 4X4 and one ute in a month.</p>

<p>Traffic lights are minimal, not in frequency but in each installation. There is only one large set of lights and one small set of lights (for bicycles) for each direction of traffic. Each set is on the close side of the intersection so if cars roll too far into the intersection they can&#8217;t see the lights change.</p>

<p>Traffic lights have no buttons for pedestrians nor pressure sensors for cars. They cycle based on time and nothing else. From what I can tell the cycle timing never changes.</p>

<p>Taxis are luxury cars. The only BMW, Mercedes and Audis I&#8217;ve seen in France have been taxis. They&#8217;re also minimally branded, the only thing that distinguishes them as cabs from the outside is a small roof mounted sign.</p>

<p>Bicycle commuting is very popular here and bikes are treated as first class road users by cars. Bikes flaunt the road rules constantly yet are never treated in anger or frustration by motorists. Bikes are calmly given right of way in all situations whether they&#8217;re breaking the rules or not.</p>

<h3>Supermarkets and Food</h3>

<p>Supermarkets sell alcohol.</p>

<p>Cashiers have seats.</p>

<p>Cashiers don&#8217;t bag your groceries, you do.</p>

<p>You won&#8217;t be given plastic bags unless you explicitly ask for them and often they cost a small amount. From what I&#8217;ve seen almost everyone has their own bags/trolley/basket.</p>

<p>Cafes rarely serve anything more than the most basic pre-prepared food, often not even that.</p>

<p>&#8220;American style&#8221; bread (i.e. non-baguette sliced bread loafs) come almost exclusively in half loaves (compared to Australian loaf size).</p>

<p>Drinks are measured in centilitres.</p>

<p>Coke cans come in 33cl, bottles come in 50cl and bottle caps are about 5mm shallower than bottles back home (<em>tiny</em> differences like that are interesting to me).</p>

<h3>Other Stuff</h3>

<p>ATMs dispense various denominations. For example, if you ask for  €100 the default is usually 1 x 50, 2 x 20 and 1 x 10. Often you can specify the exact denominations, i.e. get €100 in ten 10s if you want.</p>

<p>French computer keyboards are <a href="http://www.zacheverson.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/french-layout.gif">frustratingly similar</a> to the English qwerty layout. <em>Numbers</em> require the shift modifier!</p>

<p>Cigarette smoking is <em>much</em> more common here and heavily skews young. It seems everyone in their 20s here smokes and that&#8217;s rare back home.</p>

<p>Dogs are allowed everywhere: on buses, trains, in shops, in restaurants. A couple walked into a restaurant in Briançon with their beagle. They sat down, their beagle sat up on the third chair and stayed there while they ate their meals.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Preface: I&#8217;m deeply non-sentimental.</p>

<blockquote><p>If your house was burning, what would you take with you? It&#8217;s a conflict between what&#8217;s practical, valuable and sentimental.</p></blockquote>

<p>Featuring heavily: cameras, camera lenses, passports, <em>still commercially available books and CDs</em>, printed photographs, headphones and clothing.</p>

<p>The more I think about this question the more I doubt the people participating in this project are trying hard enough. I know it&#8217;s just a fun game to discover what things people find important but imagine people scrambling to take these things if there&#8217;s literally flames crawling up the walls, smoke everywhere, extreme heat, etc.</p>

<p>No one should have a print as their <em>only</em> copy of a photograph. I would hope that while composing these photos the participants realised how dumb it is, immediately scanned the pics and stored the files on their computer and on the internet somewhere. The same goes for any kind of &#8220;letter from grandma&#8221; type document.</p>

<p><a href="http://theburninghouse.com/post/26497459645/silka-frigault">A Charlotte Bronte book and a psychology textbook</a>!? Jane Eyre can be <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Jane-Eyre-Dover-Thrift-Editions/dp/0486424499">replaced on Amazon</a> for $4.50. Your house is literally burning down and endangering your life.</p>

<p>I guess people are taking headphones because they can&#8217;t bear to not listen to their favourite music between their house burning down and the next opportunity they might have to buy replacement headphones.</p>

<p>Apparently everyone is planning immediate overseas travel after their house burns down, that&#8217;s why the passport gets saved. Passports are easily replaced, albeit for a price but they all expire and must be replaced at some future point regardless.</p>

<p>A lot of cameras being saved. Some old ones which I imagine would be difficult to replace but mostly new cameras and new lenses. I suppose it&#8217;s to document their flaming homes turning into ashes.</p>

<p>Clothes? Urgh.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s nothing I own that I&#8217;d be truly upset to lose, for me the question is all about degree of inconvenience. Sure it&#8217;d be inconvenient to restore my data from online backups, buy new clothes I like, apply for a new passport, etc. But in the context of life endangerment inconvenience is insignificant.</p>

<p>There. That&#8217;s all the fun sucked out of that.</p>

<blockquote><p>I like how we&#8217;re talking about optimizing for Retina displays when I see sites weighing 3-6MB. Yeah, that&#8217;s the right conversation to have.</p></blockquote>

<p>For me optimising for retina displays means serving <em>less</em> images, not duplicates at higher resolutions. You can be almost guaranteed your web content being rendered at retina resolution is being rendered by WebKit with advanced CSS support obsoleting the need for many images. Potentially a retina optimised website can look much better and weigh much less than a &#8220;traditionally designed&#8221; website served to a retina screen.</p>

	        <h2 class="entry-title">From YoJimbo to Evernote</h2>
	      
			
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/yojimbo/">YoJimbo</a> has been part of my Mac experience since I started university where I used it to take notes during class on my 12&#8221; PowerBook.</p>

<p>When I got a second Mac YoJimbo was the only reason I shelled out $120/year for a MobileMe subscription. The MobileMe sync worked really well for years until it ceased to work behind my work&#8217;s network (not YoJimbo&#8217;s fault). Then iCloud superseded MobileMe and choosing to migrate meant giving up YoJimbo sync. We&#8217;re now <a href="http://www.apple.com/mobileme/">four days from the MobileMe sunset</a> with <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/yojimbo-talk/V9ICS1u4ins">no sign</a> of <a href="http://barebones.com/support/yojimbo/faqs.html#icloud">the promised</a> iCloud sync supporting update to YoJimbo</p>

<p>Meanwhile, there&#8217;s been the iPhone and the iPad. How do you get your YoJimbo content on those devices? I briefly tried <a href="http://flyingmac.com/webjimbo/">WebJimbo</a> but found it buggy, messy and could never get it to work quite right.</p>

<p>Bare Bones partially filled the gap with <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/yojimbo/tour-sidekick.html">Sidekick</a> which, if you were able to mount a remote server or publicly reveal a local web server (being careful to password protect the directory) you could access your data remotely. This is pretty good but with the minor downside no offline viewing and the major downside of read only data.</p>

<p>For the iPad there&#8217;s a slightly better solution, <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/mobile/yojimbo/">an official YoJimbo app</a>! Unfortunately it only syncs via the manual open-both-apps-while-you&#8217;re-on-the-same-network method. Without remembering to open the app before leaving your network you&#8217;re left with an out of date copy of your data, a disadvantage compared to Sidekick but with the advantage of offline viewing. Again though, your data is frustratingly read only.</p>

<p>Enter: Evernote.</p>

<p>In my usual style I ignored Evernote while everyone raved about it. I wanted to use the office iPad for taking notes at my French class. I needed something I could log into and out of with this not being my iPad and something I could easily and <em>automatically</em> get my data out of. Evernote fit the bill.</p>

<p>Soon after I got an iPad of my own and didn&#8217;t like the thought of continuing to persevere with a $10 read-only, manual syncing YoJimbo client and I switched.</p>

<p>Transferring my data out was as simple as creating equivalent notebooks in Evernote and simply dragging my items across. All notes maintained their formatting and things like software serials converted to YoJimbo&#8217;s plain text export format. It took no time at all.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll miss being able to apply custom icons to folders/notebooks, I&#8217;ll really miss colour labels but I definitely won&#8217;t miss applying <a href="http://hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/widescreen-hack-for-yojimbo-2">a hack to get a three vertical pane view</a> after every update for 7 years.</p>

	        <h2 class="entry-title">The Future of Computing</h2>
	      
			
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>This afternoon a friend I was keen to chat to and catch up with came to my place to pick up some gear. He was bringing along his kids (3 and 5-years-old) so I quickly scanned around my single, 24-year-old guy, minimal apartment looking for something that might distract them for 20 minutes. I gave up looking.</p>

<p>When they got here they darted directly at the iPad sitting on my couch and I thought &#8220;of course&#8221;!</p>

<p>I sat down with them looking through my games for something they might like. Nothing. I asked if they knew of any good games and it turns out they <em>love</em> Monkey Maths. They watched as I searched the app store. They identified the Monkey Maths icon before I did. I downloaded the free app. It downloaded in 15 seconds and they realised it was ready to play before I did.</p>

<p>I launched the game and asked if they know how to play. They pulled the iPad away from me silently saying <em>of course</em> we know how to play.</p>

<p>They played together with the iPad for a good 20 or 30 minutes while I caught up with my friend. When it was time to go the 3yo hit the home button, followed by the lock button and then expertly closed the smart cover. <em>Three years old</em>.</p>

<p>If I had any doubt left about the future of personal computing that&#8217;s well and truly gone.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Brian Lam&#8217;s advice (strangely branded as specifically for San Francisco but applicable everywhere) for loosening your attachment to your phone starts off really well:</p>

<blockquote><p>Pay attention to your date! You are here to try to have sex, which you cannot do online yet. Your phone stays in your pocket. It may ring. It may buzz. You will want to prod it. Don’t.</p></blockquote>

<p>Then it gets a little weird with very specific instructions for how to look cool using an iPad in a cafe:</p>

<blockquote><p>My only advice is simple: Lean back, cross your legs, relax your shoulders, and hold the tablet on your knee with one hand. Look as if you are reading a newspaper rather than using a computer.</p></blockquote>

<p>Back to good:</p>

<blockquote><p>Picking up a phone when running says you&#8217;re not running hard enough. Hang up the phone, run faster.</p></blockquote>

<p>More good advice for those who feel compelled to personally document an entire gig on their phones:</p>

<blockquote><p>How are you going to dance and drink and throw your sweaty arms around your date when you&#8217;re futzing with your phone?</p></blockquote>

<p>But then I couldn&#8217;t agree less with Brian on using your phone at the movies:</p>

<blockquote><p>Here&#8217;s a trick I like: Turn the brightness all the way down so you can check your phone during the slow scenes, under a coat.</p></blockquote>

<p>And how do you satisfy your insatiable thirst for Twitter updates when hanging out with your friends?</p>

<blockquote><p>Easy. In a lull, just ask if everyone wants to take a phone break. Or just declare, &#8220;phone break!&#8221; and start clicking. Everyone else will follow suit.</p></blockquote>

<p>That doesn&#8217;t sound much like &#8220;tuning in, turning off or plugging out&#8221; to me. It sounds bizarre and if it became acceptable social etiquette I would join the Amish.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re now at the point where someone feels the need to create an illustrated guide for <em>adults</em> on how to <em>show basic manners</em> in social situations. It&#8217;s like a parent telling their four year old to &#8220;say thank-you&#8221; and even the guide author can&#8217;t suggest <em>sitting through a whole movie without checking your phone</em>.</p>

<p>For me all this advice can be distilled to something simpler: be present in your life. Participate in and pay attention to what&#8217;s happening around you <em>right now</em>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As part of our Diamond Jubilee coverage ABC News posted this photo of the crowd &#8220;welcoming&#8221; the Queen at the Epsom Derby:</p>

<p>The people in this photo are at most, foregoing and at least, diminishing a <em>real live experience</em> so they can instead take a personal recording of the scene in front of them.</p>

<p>This is insane to me. Be present in the moment, either <a href="http://www.bigcontrarian.com/2010/07/06/pictures/">remember or not</a> and live your damn life. Not everything needs to be seen through a 3.5&#8221; LCD screen held in your hand.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently read Orwell&#8217;s 1984 for the first time. It was closely followed by this article about a young man born into a North Korean prison camp who is one of the few who have ever escaped. The similarities between Oceania and the prison camp blew me away. The forced labour, the extreme scarcity of resources, the culture of whistle blowing, the sexual repression and the torture were all the same.</p>

<p>As other dictatorships have fallen in recent times I look forward to the day the same happens in North Korea.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Farhad Manjoo on Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin renouncing his US citizenship before the Facebook IPO to skirt around capital gains tax:</p>

<blockquote><p>Would Eduardo Saverin have been successful anywhere else? Maybe, but not as quickly, and not as spectacularly. It was only thanks to America—thanks to the American government’s direct and indirect investments in science and technology; thanks to the U.S. justice system; the relatively safe and fair investment climate made possible by that justice system; the education system that educated all of Facebook’s workers, and on and on—it was only thanks to all of this that you know anything at all about Eduardo Saverin today.</p></blockquote>

<p>America is good at making people fabulously wealthy. The problem is that it&#8217;s equally good at making those same people so incredibly greedy and bereft of morals or gratitude that they&#8217;d do something this dishonorable. To cut ties to the nation responsible for your safety and wealth is bad enough but to do it to avoid paying them a relatively small cut of your massive fortune is despicable.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m with Marco. Finding ways to automate and streamline parts of your life should be a continual pursuit. Think about how many times you&#8217;ve lost your keys and how much time and frustration you&#8217;d have saved if years ago you purposefully decided you were going to put your keys in the same place every day forever.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Tim Riley&#8217;s post about the way solving a difficult software development problem can interfere with your entire life struck a chord with me. Although Tim&#8217;s problem was bigger than anything I&#8217;ve had to deal with, credit card processing on a client&#8217;s website, the horrible feelings are the same.</p>

<p>All software has bugs, you accept and systematically work through them. But some bugs exist on another plane, unable to be fixed through regular debugging processes. Often they&#8217;re complicated by context, an unfamiliar environment or parts out of your control. You can become <em>obsessed</em> with these bugs. When dealing with them I have an extremely difficult time thinking about anything else. I can&#8217;t read, I can&#8217;t talk to people, I&#8217;m unpleasant to be around. After hours without progress you go to bed thinking about it. Thinking about it makes you angry and frustrated but <em>you can&#8217;t stop thinking about it</em>. You spend so long at the computer you lose all perspective and follow paths that take you further from the solution. With each minute you spend banging your head against the problem you think less clearly and the possibility of solving the problem decreases. It is <em>frustrating</em>.</p>

<p>Experience reminds you how to overcome this wall. You have to get up, leave, distract yourself and come back with a fresh perspective and a clear mind. Actually doing it is difficult because it feels like quitting, it feels like you&#8217;re delaying the solution. It&#8217;s difficult if other people depend on the solution, it&#8217;s difficult because you feel like you&#8217;re close, it&#8217;s difficult because you desperately want it fixed and out of your mind. To solve the problem you have to stop trying to solve the problem, at least for a short while.</p>

<p>Tim went through this while dealing with other external stresses. His post is a great insight for non-programmers on the darker side of software development.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Twelve years ago I first started using a computer for general school work, typing up assignments and the like. I was using Microsoft Word on Windows 95. The language of either Word or the system was set to US English rather than British English which resulted in many incorrectly red underlined words. In the early days Word&#8217;s list of known names for spellchecking purpose must have been much shorter because nearly every name would also get red underlined.</p>

<p>It bothered me having something marked as wrong which I knew was right but Word had the ability to &#8220;Add word to dictionary&#8221; so that it was considered a correctly spelt word from then on. I was doing this a lot, too much it turned out. The last time I did it I got an error: &#8220;The custom learned words dictionary is full&#8221;.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t do it nearly as often any more as I know how to set my computer&#8217;s locale and many more names (including smart things like those from my contact list) are included in the spell checking dictionary.</p>

<p>But when I do, even though I&#8217;m using an operating system made by a completely different company, even though I&#8217;m using different text editing or page layout software, even though such a limited was likely stamped out of that software many versions ago, even though it&#8217;s been <em>twelve years</em>, I still have a split second of hesitation before selecting the Learn spelling menu item.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>In a world of where online news success is measured by advertising impressions the newly launched <a href="http://www.theglobalmail.org/">Global Mail</a> is taking a refreshingly scrupulous approach. Funded by philanthropy, run by an edict to serve the audience, not advertisers, staffed by many ex-ABC journalists who publish only a few articles each day.</p>

<p>The design is interesting: horizontal scrolling with article body text split into thin newspaper-like thin columns. For articles where I can easily sideways scroll with a trackpad or iPad touch screen I think it works really well. On the homepage where you can only navigate sideways with buttons it&#8217;s clunky. The Twitter ticker along the bottom of the homepage is gratuitous.</p>

<p>From what I&#8217;ve read so far the writing is top notch. I really enjoyed Mike Seccombe&#8217;s piece on <a href="http://www.theglobalmail.org/feature/why-the-super-bowl-is-a-super-bore/15/">the cultural differences between Australian and American sport</a>. All in all this is very close to the news website I&#8217;d create myself in an ideal world.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhhdmahBQU8">This video about how acupuncture works</a> by RMIT University was <a href="http://twitter.com/makenosound/status/174286341729816576">brought to my attention</a> this morning after I <a href="http://twitter.com/jimwhimpey/status/174283324586602496">made a joke</a> about chiropractors.</p>

<p>Looking past the pretty veneer you can see that it&#8217;s little more than a closed captioned two minute verbal explanation. The captions are simply animated in as the words are being spoken. One concept does get visually illustrated but it&#8217;s the <em>analogy</em>. They animate cars driving on a road, why would I need <em>that</em> illustrated, I can imagine that. You have a video, why not animate what actually happens <em>to the body</em>, <em>inside</em>, where I can&#8217;t otherwise see it!?</p>

<p>I thought that it may have just been the farcical topic of acupuncture (it magically fixes the equivalent of broken down cars in your body!) that corrupted the first video. Of course it&#8217;s hard to visualise and animate something that&#8217;s inherently flawed but the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_E4DrPRLPI">equivalent video on interest rates</a>, a subject ripe for visual explanation, is just as bad. Simply a rudimentary verbal explanation of interest rates with fancy closed captions too.</p>

<p>These kinds of &#8220;infographics&#8221; which don&#8217;t actually disseminate information at all are <a href="http://mrgan.tumblr.com/post/509200141/infographics">rife</a> at dumb sites like <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/09/30/twitter-history-infographic/">Mashable</a>. It saddens me that the same concept has leaked into what should be a richer medium for explanation and that a <em>reputable university</em> is also unable to see the difference between pretty and meaningful.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was handed the old University of Queensland Cycling Club website not long after it was launched. It was <a href="http://www.joomla.org/">Joomla</a> hell. Not only was it extremely difficult to do regular administrative stuff like <em>create pages</em> but it was very buggy and the back end was more opaque than the front. This put me in a situation where I was responsible for running the site but <em>hated</em> using it and couldn&#8217;t even take steps towards fixing it or adding anything new.</p>

<p>So I spent months recreating the whole site in WordPress and <a href="http://bbpress.org/">bbPress</a> with a custom theme and a few custom plugins. I&#8217;m really happy with how it turned as far as design and functionality goes but most importantly it frees my club from the clutches of Joomla.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been overwhelmingly happy with <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> since <a href="http://valhallaisland.com/blog/2012/octopress/">the switch</a>. There&#8217;s just one gap: image resizing and uploading. I didn&#8217;t realise how much I took this for granted with WordPress and Tumblr.</p>

<p>To fill the gap I&#8217;ve <a href="https://github.com/jimwhimpey/Blog-Image-Resizer">written a script</a> which takes a local image path, resizes a small and large version to your specification, uploads it to a server and returns a block of HTML of the small image linking to the larger one. I used it for <a href="http://valhallaisland.com/blog/2012/microsoft-apple-web/">this post</a> and it saved a lot of time. I also like that it decouples my image locations from my blog engine if ever I want to move again.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not pretty code and it&#8217;s been made specifically to cater for my requirements but I hope someone else can find it useful either as it is or as a base for something better.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been a loyal Things user for years and I&#8217;ve been using the closed beta of Things on the Mac and iPhone for many months. From the day I downloaded the first beta it&#8217;s been as solid as a rock. It was a long time coming but Cultured Code ignored the public pressure, took the time to do it right and it&#8217;s paid off. The Things syncing experience is polished to a very high gloss.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve recently been building an HTML email newsletter at work. Getting an HTML email to work across the many <a href="http://www.campaignmonitor.com/css/">extremely limited</a> and broken email clients makes IE6 debugging look like fin. I truly don&#8217;t think HTML email is worth the effort but that&#8217;s another story.</p>

<p>It meant I needed to get a Hotmail account for testing. The first time I&#8217;d used Hotmail in 6 or 7 years. As a regular iCloud webmail user I found what I think is a nice example of the difference between Apple and Microsoft at the screens shown immediately after logging in:</p>

<p>I remember as a teenager using Windows before I switched to the Mac getting frustrated about these kinds of UIs and Windows&#8217; inexplicable popularity despite it. It feels great to have watched better persist and <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=MSFT%2C+AAPL">better eventually win</a>.</p>
