  <div class="entry-content"><p>In a world of where online news success is measured by advertising impressions the newly launched <a href="http://www.theglobalmail.org/">Global Mail</a> is taking a refreshingly scrupulous approach. Funded by philanthropy, run by an edict to serve the audience, not advertisers, staffed by many ex-ABC journalists who publish only a few articles each day.</p>

<p>The design is interesting: horizontal scrolling with article body text split into thin newspaper-like thin columns. For articles where I can easily sideways scroll with a trackpad or iPad touch screen I think it works really well. On the homepage where you can only navigate sideways with buttons it&#8217;s clunky. The Twitter ticker along the bottom of the homepage is gratuitous.</p>

<p>From what I&#8217;ve read so far the writing is top notch. I really enjoyed Mike Seccombe&#8217;s piece on <a href="http://www.theglobalmail.org/feature/why-the-super-bowl-is-a-super-bore/15/">the cultural differences between Australian and American sport</a>. All in all this is very close to the news website I&#8217;d create myself in an ideal world.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhhdmahBQU8">This video about how acupuncture works</a> by RMIT University was <a href="http://twitter.com/makenosound/status/174286341729816576">brought to my attention</a> this morning after I <a href="http://twitter.com/jimwhimpey/status/174283324586602496">made a joke</a> about chiropractors.</p>

<p>Looking past the pretty veneer you can see that it&#8217;s little more than a closed captioned two minute verbal explanation. The captions are simply animated in as the words are being spoken. One concept does get visually illustrated but it&#8217;s the <em>analogy</em>. They animate cars driving on a road, why would I need <em>that</em> illustrated, I can imagine that. You have a video, why not animate what actually happens <em>to the body</em>, <em>inside</em>, where I can&#8217;t otherwise see it!?</p>

<p>I thought that it may have just been the farcical topic of acupuncture (it magically fixes the equivalent of broken down cars in your body!) that corrupted the first video. Of course it&#8217;s hard to visualise and animate something that&#8217;s inherently flawed but the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_E4DrPRLPI">equivalent video on interest rates</a>, a subject ripe for visual explanation, is just as bad. Simply a rudimentary verbal explanation of interest rates with fancy closed captions too.</p>

<p>These kinds of &#8220;infographics&#8221; which don&#8217;t actually disseminate information at all are <a href="http://mrgan.tumblr.com/post/509200141/infographics">rife</a> at dumb sites like <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/09/30/twitter-history-infographic/">Mashable</a>. It saddens me that the same concept has leaked into what should be a richer medium for explanation and that a <em>reputable university</em> is also unable to see the difference between pretty and meaningful.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was handed the old University of Queensland Cycling Club website not long after it was launched. It was <a href="http://www.joomla.org/">Joomla</a> hell. Not only was it extremely difficult to do regular administrative stuff like <em>create pages</em> but it was very buggy and the back end was more opaque than the front. This put me in a situation where I was responsible for running the site but <em>hated</em> using it and couldn&#8217;t even take steps towards fixing it or adding anything new.</p>

<p>So I spent months recreating the whole site in WordPress and <a href="http://bbpress.org/">bbPress</a> with a custom theme and a few custom plugins. I&#8217;m really happy with how it turned as far as design and functionality goes but most importantly it frees my club from the clutches of Joomla.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been overwhelmingly happy with <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> since <a href="http://valhallaisland.com/blog/2012/octopress/">the switch</a>. There&#8217;s just one gap: image resizing and uploading. I didn&#8217;t realise how much I took this for granted with WordPress and Tumblr.</p>

<p>To fill the gap I&#8217;ve <a href="https://github.com/jimwhimpey/Blog-Image-Resizer">written a script</a> which takes a local image path, resizes a small and large version to your specification, uploads it to a server and returns a block of HTML of the small image linking to the larger one. I used it for <a href="http://valhallaisland.com/blog/2012/microsoft-apple-web/">this post</a> and it saved a lot of time. I also like that it decouples my image locations from my blog engine if ever I want to move again.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not pretty code and it&#8217;s been made specifically to cater for my requirements but I hope someone else can find it useful either as it is or as a base for something better.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve recently been building an HTML email newsletter at work. Getting an HTML email to work across the many <a href="http://www.campaignmonitor.com/css/">extremely limited</a> and broken email clients makes IE6 debugging look like fin. I truly don&#8217;t think HTML email is worth the effort but that&#8217;s another story.</p>

<p>It meant I needed to get a Hotmail account for testing. The first time I&#8217;d used Hotmail in 6 or 7 years. As a regular iCloud webmail user I found what I think is a nice example of the difference between Apple and Microsoft at the screens shown immediately after logging in:</p>

	        <h2 class="entry-title">From Tumblr to Octopress</h2>
	      
			
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>The move from WordPress to Tumblr a few years ago felt great. All the focus was on posting content and I was liberated from the need to administer a blog. Since then Tumblr has struggled with stability problems while implementing weird &#8220;social features&#8221; like photo replies (but no native text replies) and getting obsessed with things like New York Fashion Week. Recently they added these <a href="http://staff.tumblr.com/post/16980189397/highlighted-posts">dumb labels</a> and I recognised Tumblr is going too far in a direction I&#8217;m not interested in.</p>

<p>I first became interested in (well, aware of) generated flat file publishing systems when I read about Brent&#8217;s <a href="http://inessential.com/2009/01/30/new_publishing_system_tour_of_my_head">homemade system</a> over three years ago. Only a couple of months after that I got a job working on a site that was using a similar flat file system on a <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/"><em>much</em> larger scale</a> (it&#8217;s only recently been replaced). I was intrigued by the big advantages of such a system: speed and simplicity.</p>

<p>My loss of respect for Tumblr coincided with reading about <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> on <a href="http://mattgemmell.com/2011/09/12/blogging-with-octopress/">Matt Gemmell&#8217;s blog</a>. It sounded perfect. It&#8217;s the kind of new wave of &#8220;hacker&#8221; software that&#8217;s well designed and a joy to use. I credit Github for this great trend.</p>

<h3>Transistion</h3>

<p>Getting my content out of Tumblr was a breeze with Jekyll&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/blog-migrations">blog mirgration script</a>. I had to make a few wholesale modifications to some paths and similar things in the post files the script created but this is where Octopress imediately demonstrated it&#8217;s advantages. I was able to do regex find and replaces across 500+ posts in a few seconds using TextMate. Doing something similar to posts stored in a database would be a real pain in the ass.</p>

<h3>Redesign</h3>

<p>The default Octopress theme is the most elegant default theme shipping with any CMS I&#8217;ve seen but it offers more than I need and in any case, I want a unique look for my blog. The CSS of the default theme is made to be customised and continuing the for hackers ideology its organised into <em>25</em> (yes twenty-five) <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> files which compile down to one CSS file. Every feature of Sass is used, everything is modular, everything is a variable. I was hoping to reuse some of the responsive stuff but it was too complex and I ended up throwing it all out and starting again with my own CSS.</p>

<p>Logic in the template files is handled by <a href="http://liquidmarkup.org/">Liquid</a> which made them easy to modify and generally work with.</p>

<p>When I first started out blogging with WordPress around 8 or 9 years ago I would compulsively redesign my site. Looking back this was fantastic, with every new redesign I&#8217;d learn so much. It might say something about my maturity or current state of mind that even though I&#8217;ve been using this design for over a year and moving to Octopress was an ideal opportunity to change it, I&#8217;ve kept everything the same with only some subtle updates.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d love to create some publicly available Octopress themes just as I did for WordPress and then Tumblr.</p>

<h3>Images</h3>

<p>The only thing missing is a simple way to process images. I need something that I can easily pass through an original, have it resize to a small and a large, upload them to a server somewhere and return some Markdown pointing to the large surrounded by a link to the larger one. I&#8217;ll write a simple script to do this for me and the result will be images decoupled from my publishing system.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: I solved this problem with an <a href="http://valhallaisland.com/blog/2012/octopress-image-resizer/">image resizing script</a>.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>I&#8217;ve been using Octopress for a week now and I&#8217;ve immediately noticed the blazing speed. I don&#8217;t write much that gets big traffic but I can rest assured know that if I do it&#8217;ll no doubt handle the load with room to spare. Another great advantage is the simple ability to use proper version control for the <em>whole</em> site, both the code that generates it and the generated blog. I love the whole workflow.</p>

<p>While I&#8217;m not publishing with Tumblr anymore I still use it to read the Tumblr blogs I follow. All week I&#8217;ve been seeing <a href="http://cl.ly/3d3C3W2I0l0t1P2X3q1E">this</a> promoted in the dashboard sidebar. It feels like I left just in time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Before I left work this afternoon I thought I&#8217;d try a different barber closer to my new office. I checked online and discovered there wasn&#8217;t one as close as what I&#8217;d hoped so I resolved to just stop in at the same barbershop I&#8217;ve been going to for the last couple of years.</p>

<p>When I got there the &#8220;closed&#8221; sign was hanging. I looked at the opening hours on the door: &#8220;Mon-Fri 8am to 5:30pm&#8221;. I looked at my bike computer: 5:14pm. I got the attention of someone inside and asked what was going on. She said it takes them 15 minutes to clean and they won&#8217;t start on someone in the last 15 minutes. I tried to talk her around. She was steadfast.</p>

<p>This pissed me off and I <a href="http://twitter.com/jimwhimpey/status/169321194183593984">vented on Twitter</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>My hair takes 15-20 minutes to cut. I&#8217;ve been going to that barber for years. Not anymore.</p></blockquote>

<p>I got a <a href="http://twitter.com/freshtonic/status/169327784727023616">couple</a> of <a href="http://twitter.com/kondro/status/169322614198767616">responses</a> suggesting it&#8217;s a bit drastic to cut ties considering I&#8217;ve been going there so long.</p>

<p>The fact I&#8217;ve been going there so long is another reason they should have served me. Would it be so difficult to cut someone&#8217;s hair 15 minutes <em>before you close</em>, clean up around me and stay back 5 or 10 minutes? For someone who&#8217;s spent hundreds of dollars there over the years?</p>

<p>There&#8217;s nothing exceptional about this barber and for me, barbers are interchangable. There&#8217;s literally 20 options a short distance from work and home. There&#8217;s nothing at all tying me to my regular barber, they&#8217;re simply one of many very similar options. Serving me after they&#8217;d turned the sign (even though it was 15 minutes before closing) may have created a tie. Instead they&#8217;ve given me a great reason to choose someone else.</p>

<blockquote><p>Seems to me that Kickstarter is the most important tech company since Facebook. Maybe more important in the long run.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;d say <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/">Kickstarter</a>, a service which completely turns the table on product development, artistic endeavours, innovation and brings new meaning to the whole concept of supply and demand, is <em>definitely</em> more important than Facebook, a service which facilitates friends chatting and sharing photos.</p>

The core of Tumblr has remained the same but the steady addition of gratuitous features pandering to the teenage masses participating in an online popularity contest has put me off.

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/stevedenning/2011/11/28/maximizing-shareholder-value-the-dumbest-idea-in-the-world/">Maximising shareholder value</a> that is. Roger Martin in his book Fixing the Game:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Imagine an NFL coach holding a press conference on Wednesday to announce that he predicts a win by 9 points on Sunday, and that bettors should recognize that the current spread of 6 points is too low. Or picture the team’s quarterback standing up in the postgame press conference and apologizing for having only won by 3 points when the final betting spread was 9 points in his team’s favor. While it’s laughable to imagine coaches or quarterbacks doing so, CEOs are expected to do both of these things.</p>

  

  <p>[&#8230;]</p>

  

  <p>If this were the situation in the NFL, then everyone would realize that the “real game” of football had become utterly corrupted by the “expectations game” of gambling.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>This is why I&#8217;d be bothered about Facebook&#8217;s IPO if I had an account there, the focus will be moved from what&#8217;s best for you as a customer to what&#8217;s best for the shareholder. I don&#8217;t even know why Facebook would want to do it, they had $3.5 billion of revenue last year, they don&#8217;t need the money and they&#8217;d lose control.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m definitely not a car person. I&#8217;ll go as far to say that cars are inherently flawed and even fuelled by 100% clean energy their prevalence has many negative consequences. But I digress, I wanted to write about the couple of things Tesla did right.</p>



<ol><li>It looks like a regular car. Not that the Prius is a great example of an electric car but I think they really fucked up by making it look so unlike &#8220;normal&#8221; cars. And not that I think regular cars look or function that well. I think not freaking people out with <a href="http://www.autoscraze.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Mitsubishi-i-MiEV.jpg">radically ugly</a> electric cars is a good step towards adoption.</li>

<li>The mileage the 85 kWh battery gets (480km) makes the car usable in the only scenario where cars are truly appropriate: travelling as efficiently as possible to remote places.</li>

<li>They made it regular sized. It can even carry 7 people with a special seat configuration. Like I said <a href="http://valhallaisland.com/post/16517415963">a couple of days ago</a>, a tiny car with low range that just carries one person is barely better than walking.</li>

<li>It uses a regular power outlet with the option for a higher powered specialty charger. The <a href="http://www.nissanusa.com/leaf-electric-car/index#/leaf-electric-car/video/all/LEAF_technology/charging">Leaf</a> requires a special thing installed by an electrician in your garage making impromptu charges impossible.</li>

</ol><p>I think they&#8217;ve done a lot of things right to get it widely adopted.</p>



<p>But I think they&#8217;ve gone wrong with the ridiculous number of options. There&#8217;s 54 possible combinations of model, wheel and roof. Those are only three of many other decisions you have to make. The possible combinations go into the thousands. $250 for an optional parcel shelf!? Just decide for me whether it&#8217;s a good idea, if it is, put it in and charge me for it.</p>



<p>The same goes for the battery capacities. It&#8217;s obviously the most expensive thing about the car so removing capacity reduces the cost making it more accessible but it also removes the number one advantage: long range.</p>

  <p>At a get-together of home schoolers in a suburban park in Brisbane, one mother, Cindy, said she was about to start home schooling her son but was afraid of the paperwork involved.</p>

  

  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not planning (on registering) because of the work involved,&#8221; she said.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Segway didn&#8217;t spawn a transportation revolution because what it&#8217;s trying to replace is walking, the simplest, cheapest, most convenient and most environmentally friendly transport there is. Walking is the preference. If it can be walked people want to walk it.</p>



<p>The same goes for <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-01-25/fold-up-car-unveiled-in-europe/3791794">these kinds of tiny electric cars</a> unveiled every six months or so and sold as the &#8220;answer to urban stress and pollution&#8221;.</p>



<p>A better (i.e. smaller, electricity powered) car is not the solution to transportation and social problems in urban centres which have been designed around the car but don&#8217;t need them.</p>



<p>These cars barely carry two people, never luggage and they only have a range of around 100km (which actually means a range of 50km if you want to get home). There&#8217;s much better ways to transport a single person that kind of distance with no luggage through a city. They feel like steps towards the future imagined in Wall-E:</p>



<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyeljshd9Q1qzw2y9.png" alt="Wall-E hover chairs"/></p>



<p>We&#8217;re so car dependant/absorbed that we can&#8217;t even look away from cars as a solution to our car problem. It reminds me of that Henry Ford quote (possibly joke?): &#8220;If I&#8217;d asked my customers what they wanted, they&#8217;d have said a faster horse.&#8221; There are a lot of problems with cars in cities, just as there were with horses 100 years ago and everyone thinks the solution is a faster horse.</p>

<p>It seems completely bizarre that Arthur Brisbane has to <a href="http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/12/should-the-times-be-a-truth-vigilante/?pagewanted=all">ask this question</a> but I see this constantly <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/">at work</a>. It&#8217;s especially prevalent during election campaigns when it&#8217;s a constant barrage of reporting on what he <em>said</em> and what she <em>said</em> with zero verification on whether there&#8217;s any truth whatsoever in those words.</p>
