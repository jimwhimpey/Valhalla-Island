Two years and many listens later it still makes me laugh a lot. Relistening to these old clips makes me really miss the audio only days of Maniacal Rage podcast.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I <em>hate</em> ad supported software. If it&#8217;s an app I love I want to pay for it, if I don&#8217;t totally love it and it&#8217;s ad supported with no option I won&#8217;t use it. I don&#8217;t want my experience degraded by having ads shoved down my throat nor do I want the burden of ignoring them.</p>



<p>This is the most extreme form of ad supported software I&#8217;ve seen. It blows my mind how horrible this is. It shows complete disrespect for the user&#8217;s time. Microsoft have obviously written off the Zune as a great handheld media player and see it just as a tiny screen they can use to infiltrate people&#8217;s lives with advertising. How <em>embarrassing</em> it must be to own a Zune. Via <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/09/17/zune-hd">Daring Fireball</a>.</p>

I knew processed foods were bad but I never understood why or what processing even meant. The dietician described it beautifully: processed food is pre-chewed food.  A machine takes your natural, whole ingredients, chews them up, all the while removing nutrients, energy and other good stuff before pumping them with preservatives and spitting it out, ready for you to eat, just like it was at the start of the process, only no where near as good for you.</p>

	        <h2 class="entry-title">Frustrating Finance</h2>
	      
			
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>No matter how impulsively I&#8217;m spending my money, as long as I&#8217;m keeping track of where it&#8217;s going, how much I have left and when more is likely to come in, I never feel out of control. This is why I&#8217;ve invested so much time in <a href="http://www.midnightapps.com/chaching/">Cha-Ching</a>, an increasingly frustrating endeavour.</p>



<p>Finance is the slum category of Mac software. The <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/business_finance/">options</a> are ugly, overflowing with superfluous features, completely ignore convention, lack polish and are plain un-Mac-like. Cha-Ching is the best of a horrible bunch and even it has glaring issues, I&#8217;ve written about one <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/91062909">particularly frustrating &#8220;feature&#8221;</a> before.</p>



<p>Recently I&#8217;ve decided to get a little more serious about my finance management and organise my income and expenditures properly. This is ridiculously difficult in Cha-Ching. Some of my issues:</p>



<ul><li>Cha-Ching provides a huge list of default categories, some broad, some obscure, only a few of which I want to use. You can add and remove your own categories but you cannot modify the default list. Your own custom categories are presented beneath the defaults making selecting a category needlessly tedious.</li>

<li>Tagging behaviour works unlike anything I&#8217;ve used <em>anywhere</em> before. If you&#8217;ve previously entered a lowercase tag, <em>even if you delete the tag and the entry it was attached to</em>, it is <em>impossible</em> to enter the same tag in title case. There&#8217;s so many tiny behavioural oddities in the tags field it&#8217;s hard to articulate what&#8217;s wrong with it.</li>

<li>The image selector laboriously forces you to scroll through an unnecessarily small field of images before dragging the image onto a drop zone. A search box is provided but simply doesn&#8217;t work in my experience. Not only is it a very strange way of labelling an entry with an image but it&#8217;s super buggy, the image list scroll area is full of empty images and duplicates. Additionally there is no option to assign an image to an entire category or assign them to scheduled transactions.</li>

<li>Custom drop down boxes do not accept tab focus and cannot be controlled by keyboard, adding to the extremely slow process of adding or editing data.</li>

<li>Custom buttons have no keyboard shortcuts and also don&#8217;t accept tab focus.</li>

<li>Scheduled transactions need to be manually &#8220;paid&#8221; to appear in your transaction lists rendering them almost completely useless. A plain text list of scheduled transactions would do the job almost as well.</li>

</ul><p>In it&#8217;s defence Cha-Ching is officially a &#8220;beta&#8221; application but when you&#8217;re at the 2.0 release and no longer offering the 1.0 a beta label smells much less like pre-release software and much more like a scapegoat.</p>



<p>What frustrates me most about this list is that they all relate directly to <em>storing your financial data</em>, the single piece of functionality a finance application needs to get right. Meanwhile Cha-Ching features a to do list manager, a companion iPhone app and a fucking <em>web browser</em>.</p>



<p>Cha-Ching has a solid base, there&#8217;s relatively little it needs to fix to become a great Mac application. In a few cases problems would be solved by simply using system default controls rather than custom ones. Yet core functionality remains half done and unpolished while almost-totally-unrelated-to-finance features are added equally half heartedly.</p>

Snow Leopard broke Wide Mail and <a href="http://barebones.com/products/yojimbo/">YoJimbo 2</a> broke the hack with no new option to replace the need for a hack.</p>



<p>They&#8217;re two of my most used applications, two of the small group I keep running all the time. It&#8217;s really disrupted my computing experience. The item list on item view layout is so <em>inefficient</em> and contrary to the conceptual sense it makes to drill down from left to right.</p>



<p><a href="http://www.newsgator.com/INDIVIDUALS/NETNEWSWIRE/">NetNewsWire</a> defaults to the inferior layout but provides vastly superior options. I&#8217;m surprised Mail in Snow Leopard and YoJimbo 2 have persisted with the obviously inferior layout and no option to correct it.</p>

It&#8217;s the kind of bike pros are still riding today and it was just luck and good timing that I was able to get it at a price within my budget. It was clear after only riding it the 5km home from the bike store that it&#8217;s lightyears ahead of anything I&#8217;ve ridden before.</p>



<p>For now I&#8217;m using quite a high raised stem to slowly ease my spine back into cycling.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last night I saw a friend&#8217;s band play over an hour away down the coast. I didn&#8217;t get home until after midnight but had to wake up at my usual 6am for work. Usually I get to bed at around 8.30 or 9pm and get a solid 9 hours sleep. Usually I go through 4 or 5 spells each day of uncontrollable yawning with a feeling of extreme tiredness and I never feel fully rested or as alert as I did today, after only 5 and a half hours sleep.</p>



<p>Amount of sleep to feeling of being rested is a parabolic function. Two hours too little or two hours too much, you&#8217;re just as tired all day. 9 hours is much more each night than anyone else I know, I&#8217;m going to start going to bed later to feel better rested with the bonus of an hour or two extra each day to get things done.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>From the day I signed up for Twitter almost three years ago I used <a href="http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific">Twitterrific</a>. A few months ago when <a href="http://www.atebits.com/tweetie-mac/">Tweetie</a> was released I made the switch. It was a small learning curve but up until I recently switched back to Twitterrific, I&#8217;d totally forgotten about the differences. The most notable one and reason I switched to Tweetie in the first place is the behaviour that immediately follows an update.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote>One thing that was very clear after all these conversations about phones is that there is no “one size fits all” in this market. On Oct. 6th, you’ll see new Windows phones designed for a variety of tastes, needs and price points - with or without keyboards, with or without touch screens, as well as your choice of GPS, accelerometer and high resolution camera.</blockquote><p>This is what&#8217;s <a href="http://windowsteamblog.com/blogs/windowsphone/archive/2009/09/01/windows-phones-are-coming-on-october-6th.aspx">wrong</a> with Microsoft, why is there a choice of GPS, accelerometer and high resolution camera? Why would any one person not want one of those? There&#8217;s no downside. Are customers telling them &#8220;I would love GPS and an accelerometer but give me a <em>low resolution camera</em>, not that high resolution crap!&#8221;?</p>
