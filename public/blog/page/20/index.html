	        <h2 class="entry-title">The Mac Pro</h2>
	      
			
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>For a long time I&#8217;ve been totally satisfied with the 24&#8221; iMac. It&#8217;s powerful (enough), the screen is big and it&#8217;s great value. Since picking up my new Macbook Pro, with it&#8217;s faster processor, LED screen and ability to power a 30&#8221; second screen my iMac feels very limited.</p>



<p>Then I <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/190104473">got frustrated</a> with my 20&#8221; second screen and started thinking about a single bigger display altogether. Just as I run out of hard drive space. The iMac can only power a second screen with resolution up to 1920 x 1280 (24&#8221; usually) but I want to ditch the dual setup, go single and bigger. The iMac can&#8217;t take additional external drives and even replacing the internal drive is a difficult task. I can always buy more external drives but they&#8217;re more expensive, can be unreliable when running through multiple USB hubs and the speed has nothing on internal drives.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m ready to upgrade from the iMac. So what&#8217;s the next step? The Mac Pro. A computer that starts at ridiculously powerful and the-cost-of-a-small-island expensive and only goes up from there.</p>



<p>My iMac is $2500, the baseline Mac Pro is $4500, add a 24&#8221; screen and you&#8217;re looking at $6000. A $3500 jump for the next logical step in the Mac desktop lineup. $3500 for the ability to customise with multiple hard drives and video cards. The gap between the iMac and the Mac Pro is huge. A Core 2 Duo powered Mac Pro would do the job but I doubt Apple want their Mac Pros to be seen as anything but beastly powerful machines.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote>For diamonds do appear to be, just like broken glass to me.</blockquote>Quoting Panic at the Disco lyrics makes me feel 14 years old but this line resonates strongly with me. I don&#8217;t understand jewellery at all. I can&#8217;t think of a greater waste of money. Even watches, the only piece of jewellery with any practical utility whatsoever are too decorative and expensive to be worth it.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A week ago I cleaned my wireless Apple keyboard as I had many times before. This time it left my p,&#160;; and / keys nonfunctional, rendering the whole keyboard useless. This comes at a time I was thinking about replacing my regular Apple keyboard at work with the wireless equivalent.</p>



<p>The decision to get the wireless keyboard in the first place was hard enough — $109 to replace something perfectly functioning, only wireless is ridiculously decadent. Yet having to use the wired version is driving me insane. I realise these are irrational feelings, there&#8217;s no practical reason I need a wireless keyboard at all let alone in exchange for $109.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jimwhimpey/2966100477/">My Day, Yesterday, One Year Ago</a></p><p>I was reminded lately about Garrett Murray&#8217;s <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/mydayyesterday/pool/">My Day, Yesterday Flickr pool</a> I participated in. It was a fun exercise at the time (I find video and audio editing oddly soothing) but it&#8217;s especially interesting looking back. Just one year later my days are vastly different, I can&#8217;t believe I drove from home to one campus and back before getting the train to another and getting home after dark. More than 3 hours of travel for just 3 hours of class!</p>



<p>I&#8217;m someone who finds it difficult to interrupt what I&#8217;m doing to take photos or record video in day to day life so I have little record (beyond memories) of what life was like at any one time. Dedicating a day every year or so to something like this could really be valuable to someone like me.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I <em>hate</em> ad supported software. If it&#8217;s an app I love I want to pay for it, if I don&#8217;t totally love it and it&#8217;s ad supported with no option I won&#8217;t use it. I don&#8217;t want my experience degraded by having ads shoved down my throat nor do I want the burden of ignoring them.</p>



<p>This is the most extreme form of ad supported software I&#8217;ve seen. It blows my mind how horrible this is. It shows complete disrespect for the user&#8217;s time. Microsoft have obviously written off the Zune as a great handheld media player and see it just as a tiny screen they can use to infiltrate people&#8217;s lives with advertising. How <em>embarrassing</em> it must be to own a Zune. Via <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/09/17/zune-hd">Daring Fireball</a>.</p>

I knew processed foods were bad but I never understood why or what processing even meant. The dietician described it beautifully: processed food is pre-chewed food.  A machine takes your natural, whole ingredients, chews them up, all the while removing nutrients, energy and other good stuff before pumping them with preservatives and spitting it out, ready for you to eat, just like it was at the start of the process, only no where near as good for you.</p>

	        <h2 class="entry-title">Frustrating Finance</h2>
	      
			
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>No matter how impulsively I&#8217;m spending my money, as long as I&#8217;m keeping track of where it&#8217;s going, how much I have left and when more is likely to come in, I never feel out of control. This is why I&#8217;ve invested so much time in <a href="http://www.midnightapps.com/chaching/">Cha-Ching</a>, an increasingly frustrating endeavour.</p>



<p>Finance is the slum category of Mac software. The <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/business_finance/">options</a> are ugly, overflowing with superfluous features, completely ignore convention, lack polish and are plain un-Mac-like. Cha-Ching is the best of a horrible bunch and even it has glaring issues, I&#8217;ve written about one <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/91062909">particularly frustrating &#8220;feature&#8221;</a> before.</p>



<p>Recently I&#8217;ve decided to get a little more serious about my finance management and organise my income and expenditures properly. This is ridiculously difficult in Cha-Ching. Some of my issues:</p>



<ul><li>Cha-Ching provides a huge list of default categories, some broad, some obscure, only a few of which I want to use. You can add and remove your own categories but you cannot modify the default list. Your own custom categories are presented beneath the defaults making selecting a category needlessly tedious.</li>

<li>Tagging behaviour works unlike anything I&#8217;ve used <em>anywhere</em> before. If you&#8217;ve previously entered a lowercase tag, <em>even if you delete the tag and the entry it was attached to</em>, it is <em>impossible</em> to enter the same tag in title case. There&#8217;s so many tiny behavioural oddities in the tags field it&#8217;s hard to articulate what&#8217;s wrong with it.</li>

<li>The image selector laboriously forces you to scroll through an unnecessarily small field of images before dragging the image onto a drop zone. A search box is provided but simply doesn&#8217;t work in my experience. Not only is it a very strange way of labelling an entry with an image but it&#8217;s super buggy, the image list scroll area is full of empty images and duplicates. Additionally there is no option to assign an image to an entire category or assign them to scheduled transactions.</li>

<li>Custom drop down boxes do not accept tab focus and cannot be controlled by keyboard, adding to the extremely slow process of adding or editing data.</li>

<li>Custom buttons have no keyboard shortcuts and also don&#8217;t accept tab focus.</li>

<li>Scheduled transactions need to be manually &#8220;paid&#8221; to appear in your transaction lists rendering them almost completely useless. A plain text list of scheduled transactions would do the job almost as well.</li>

</ul><p>In it&#8217;s defence Cha-Ching is officially a &#8220;beta&#8221; application but when you&#8217;re at the 2.0 release and no longer offering the 1.0 a beta label smells much less like pre-release software and much more like a scapegoat.</p>



<p>What frustrates me most about this list is that they all relate directly to <em>storing your financial data</em>, the single piece of functionality a finance application needs to get right. Meanwhile Cha-Ching features a to do list manager, a companion iPhone app and a fucking <em>web browser</em>.</p>



<p>Cha-Ching has a solid base, there&#8217;s relatively little it needs to fix to become a great Mac application. In a few cases problems would be solved by simply using system default controls rather than custom ones. Yet core functionality remains half done and unpolished while almost-totally-unrelated-to-finance features are added equally half heartedly.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve finally finished the traditional OS X major release review from John Siracusa at Ars Technica. It&#8217;s extremely long and split into a frustrating, <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a>-unfriendly 23 (!) pages but finish it knowing there&#8217;s no need to read another article on the subject. As always it&#8217;s written in a narrative style with a number of high quality visual aids. If you&#8217;re interested in Apple, Leopard, Snow Leopard, operating systems or <em>computers in general</em>, it&#8217;s well worth your time.</p>
