<p>Some observations on <a href="http://www.sonystyle.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CategoryDisplay?catalogId=10551&amp;storeId=10151&amp;langId=-1&amp;categoryId=8198552921644751998#/Feature_DualView">Sony&#8217;s Google TV</a> remote:</p>



<ul><li>The yellow, blue, red and green buttons <em>also</em> have text labels (does anyone know what those ambiguous buttons on a remote even do!?)</li>

<li>Despite having a <em>full keyboard</em> the eject button requires the function modifier key (and sits in a curious position).</li>

<li><em>Lots</em> of things require modifier keys.</li>

<li>There are <em>four modifier keys</em>.</li>

<li>There are <em>two power buttons</em>.</li>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>As far as simply enjoying a video goes I <em>love</em> this commercial from Microsoft. It beautifully ridicules a phenomenon that really annoys me and that I&#8217;m ever conscious of <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/737271650">avoiding personally</a>. But as a sales pitch for a phone? <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/garrettmurray/status/27074080635">Garrett Murray</a>:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Point of new Windows 7 Phone commercials seems to be &#8220;Tired of that phone you love using all the time? You won&#8217;t wanna use ours that much.&#8221;</p>

</blockquote>



<p>It&#8217;s a great commercial for being present and connected to the physical world around you rather than for a phone.</p>



<p>Compare with the <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/gallery/ads.html#ad-every">iPhone ads</a> which show nothing but the phone in use.</p>

	        <h2 class="entry-title">The Marketing Department</h2>
	      
			
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Through a friend I heard about <a href="http://www.theapplebrisbane.com.au/">The Apple apartments</a>, a new building being built in the city full of one bedrooms for a reasonable price. My idea of an <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/271313749">ideal home</a> has always been one bedroom (ish), although a house rather an apartment but that&#8217;s unrealistic as close as I want to be to the city.</p>



<p>Perhaps being in the market for something like this in the near future I naturally looked them up online. The main thing I was looking for was a completion date, instead I get:</p>



<ul><li>An unskippable Flash splash page.</li>

<li>A video of the same model doing various activities in different outfits cut between stock footage of Brisbane.</li>

<li>Flash slideshows of the same model doing more various things.</li>

<li>Meaningless marketing gobbledegook such as:

<blockquote style="margin-top: 10px;">We have a new world city view on life. The world is now full of fast energy with intelligent phones, wireless internet, casual working hours and a commitment to being kind to the environment.</blockquote></li>

<li>Information embedded in PDFs displayed using an insane Flash app with an excruciatingly slow page turn animation and <em>sound effects</em>.</li>

<li>A 56 page brochure made up almost entirely of full page photographs of the same model doing various activities, stock images and random photos of the city with text overlays saying things like “make a difference” and “it’s all yours”.</li>

</ul><p>When I was told simply what they were, one bedroom apartments, priced well and in a great location, I was very interested.  When I find try to find out more from their official marketing I&#8217;m thoroughly put off the entire thing.</p>



<p>Just like when I find myself being swayed by a well done advertising campaign that focuses on anything but product I remind myself that the marketing department and the product department are disconnected parties. In many cases the marketing department probably isn&#8217;t even part of the company. A good advertising campaign doesn&#8217;t mean a good product.</p>



<p>It works both ways, The Apple Apartments terrible marketing material doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean the product is terrible but it sure makes it difficult.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Specifically the radar, recommended blogs and Tumblr Tuesday modules with options to hide only those you want hidden.</p>



<p><a href="http://static.jimwhimpey.com/bundles/extensions/sidebarhidlr/SidebarHidlr.safariextz">Download Sidebar Hidlr</a></p>



<p>I made this to scratch my own itch. The radar annoys me because 90% of the time it&#8217;s the same (literally, the turnover is really low) crap. Recommended blogs annoys me because the recommendations are bad. Tumblr Tuesday annoys me because it&#8217;s set to show on US time which is Wednesday my time and I don&#8217;t follow any blogs which fall into the categories it defines. They&#8217;re all distractions I could do without. The radar and recommended blogs have hide toggles but they very quickly forget about being hidden and I&#8217;ve gotten sick of clicking the hide button.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/video/2010/09/24/3021586.htm">Kerry O&#8217;Brien Leaves The 7.30 Report</a></p><p>After 45 years in journalism and 15 years as the host of The 7.30 Report this is truly the end of an era. For as long as I can remember Kerry O&#8217;Brien has been the only journalist legitimately holding politicians feet to the fire.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s strange listening to Kerry on the other side of the table but there&#8217;s some great stuff in this interview with Colvin. In response to questions of his neutrality in the recent election campaign:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>I would think anybody who sat down and looked at playbacks of both sets of interviews that I did in that campaign would be rather embarrassed if they persisted with that line.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>And on interviewing John Howard:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>He was a tough person to interview. Much in the way that I would imagine it&#8217;d be like bowling to Geoff Boycott. In that he played a very straight bat and often a very defensive bat but if a loose ball came along he was very quick to dispatch it.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>What other national news program anchor would use a cricket analogy to describe 12 years of interviews with a Prime Minister? It&#8217;s people like Kerry O&#8217;Brien who make me proud to work for the ABC over any other media organisation.</p>

<p>The thought of being bored boggles my mind. I&#8217;m constantly dismissing practical things I&#8217;d love to do because time is limited. I&#8217;m constantly evaluating the things I do spend my time on questioning whether it&#8217;s really what I want to be doing more than all those things I don&#8217;t do. We live in an world where amazing things are always at our fingertips. I couldn&#8217;t imagine being bored if I lived to 250 years.

  <div class="entry-content"><img src="/assets/tumblr/tumblr_l8qhzgzlj61qzwfbio1_500.png"/><br/><p>The way iCal works is a perfect example of a real world metaphor being followed faithfully  to a fault. Calendars present whole calendar months because they don&#8217;t know what day it is, your computer does and it should take advantage of that knowledge.</p>



<p>In this case it&#8217;s the middle of the month and I want to see what&#8217;s happening early next next month <em>in the context of today</em>. Hit the arrow button and you&#8217;re in the next month without context. It&#8217;s impossible to see four weeks ahead of the current day in the same view yet I&#8217;m being shown two weeks of events in the past which I no longer care about at all.</p>



<p>I think I&#8217;ve been frustrated by and blogged about this at least four times over the past five years. Surely someone has fixed this problem?</p>

I must have spent almost every dollar I earnt as a teenager on those CDs. In the end I got back about 1/24th of what I originally paid retail. Dying media, eh?</p>



<p>Anyway, I&#8217;ve recently been reading Our Choice by Al Gore, a big heavy book in an almost square shape with textbook-like thick paper and a soft cover. This thing is frustratingly difficult to read and has prompted me to buy a Kindle. To finance the purchase I&#8217;m getting rid of the few books I&#8217;ve acquired over the years that I know I&#8217;ll never read again or that I can buy again as Kindle books, i.e. all of them.</p>



<p>To help my get rid of them I&#8217;ve made a website: <a href="http://jimsbooksale.heroku.com/">jimsbooksale.heroku.com</a> It&#8217;s a Sinatra app with DataMapper interfacing a PostGre database running on <a href="http://heroku.com/">Heroku</a>. The whole thing took about 10 hours from start to finish and I&#8217;m once again blown away by how easy and what a joy it is to make things with this stack.</p>



<p>Unless you live in the inner Brisbane suburbs and can pick it up it&#8217;s probably not worth your while requesting anything but if you want a number of books let me know and I can organise shipping.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m too young to be so excited by something like this but (thanks to <a href="http://a.wholelottanothing.org/">Matt</a>) I&#8217;ve only just come across Mike Davidson&#8217;s blog documenting his process of building an amazing house from start to finish. Every detail is covered down to appliance choices including piece by piece costing breakdowns for the entire thing.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s nothing better than finding a great <em>mature</em> blog. It&#8217;s like waiting until a good TV show comes out on DVD. I can&#8217;t wait to read through the whole tale from the beginning.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Remember the hype around Virb before it even launched the first time? Remember the hype around Virb as a MySpace and Facebook <em>killer</em> when it actually did launch? Yeah, well it failed and completely shut down. Now it&#8217;s back as an entirely new thing!</p>



<p>Doesn&#8217;t give me a lot of faith in a website when they were once another thing entirely.</p>
