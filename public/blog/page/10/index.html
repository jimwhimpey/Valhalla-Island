  <div class="entry-content"><p>Specifically the radar, recommended blogs and Tumblr Tuesday modules with options to hide only those you want hidden.</p>



<p><a href="http://static.jimwhimpey.com/bundles/extensions/sidebarhidlr/SidebarHidlr.safariextz">Download Sidebar Hidlr</a></p>



<p>I made this to scratch my own itch. The radar annoys me because 90% of the time it&#8217;s the same (literally, the turnover is really low) crap. Recommended blogs annoys me because the recommendations are bad. Tumblr Tuesday annoys me because it&#8217;s set to show on US time which is Wednesday my time and I don&#8217;t follow any blogs which fall into the categories it defines. They&#8217;re all distractions I could do without. The radar and recommended blogs have hide toggles but they very quickly forget about being hidden and I&#8217;ve gotten sick of clicking the hide button.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/video/2010/09/24/3021586.htm">Kerry O&#8217;Brien Leaves The 7.30 Report</a></p><p>After 45 years in journalism and 15 years as the host of The 7.30 Report this is truly the end of an era. For as long as I can remember Kerry O&#8217;Brien has been the only journalist legitimately holding politicians feet to the fire.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s strange listening to Kerry on the other side of the table but there&#8217;s some great stuff in this interview with Colvin. In response to questions of his neutrality in the recent election campaign:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>I would think anybody who sat down and looked at playbacks of both sets of interviews that I did in that campaign would be rather embarrassed if they persisted with that line.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>And on interviewing John Howard:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>He was a tough person to interview. Much in the way that I would imagine it&#8217;d be like bowling to Geoff Boycott. In that he played a very straight bat and often a very defensive bat but if a loose ball came along he was very quick to dispatch it.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>What other national news program anchor would use a cricket analogy to describe 12 years of interviews with a Prime Minister? It&#8217;s people like Kerry O&#8217;Brien who make me proud to work for the ABC over any other media organisation.</p>

<p>The thought of being bored boggles my mind. I&#8217;m constantly dismissing practical things I&#8217;d love to do because time is limited. I&#8217;m constantly evaluating the things I do spend my time on questioning whether it&#8217;s really what I want to be doing more than all those things I don&#8217;t do. We live in an world where amazing things are always at our fingertips. I couldn&#8217;t imagine being bored if I lived to 250 years.

  <div class="entry-content"><img src="/assets/tumblr/tumblr_l8qhzgzlj61qzwfbio1_500.png"/><br/><p>The way iCal works is a perfect example of a real world metaphor being followed faithfully  to a fault. Calendars present whole calendar months because they don&#8217;t know what day it is, your computer does and it should take advantage of that knowledge.</p>



<p>In this case it&#8217;s the middle of the month and I want to see what&#8217;s happening early next next month <em>in the context of today</em>. Hit the arrow button and you&#8217;re in the next month without context. It&#8217;s impossible to see four weeks ahead of the current day in the same view yet I&#8217;m being shown two weeks of events in the past which I no longer care about at all.</p>



<p>I think I&#8217;ve been frustrated by and blogged about this at least four times over the past five years. Surely someone has fixed this problem?</p>

I must have spent almost every dollar I earnt as a teenager on those CDs. In the end I got back about 1/24th of what I originally paid retail. Dying media, eh?</p>



<p>Anyway, I&#8217;ve recently been reading Our Choice by Al Gore, a big heavy book in an almost square shape with textbook-like thick paper and a soft cover. This thing is frustratingly difficult to read and has prompted me to buy a Kindle. To finance the purchase I&#8217;m getting rid of the few books I&#8217;ve acquired over the years that I know I&#8217;ll never read again or that I can buy again as Kindle books, i.e. all of them.</p>



<p>To help my get rid of them I&#8217;ve made a website: <a href="http://jimsbooksale.heroku.com/">jimsbooksale.heroku.com</a> It&#8217;s a Sinatra app with DataMapper interfacing a PostGre database running on <a href="http://heroku.com/">Heroku</a>. The whole thing took about 10 hours from start to finish and I&#8217;m once again blown away by how easy and what a joy it is to make things with this stack.</p>



<p>Unless you live in the inner Brisbane suburbs and can pick it up it&#8217;s probably not worth your while requesting anything but if you want a number of books let me know and I can organise shipping.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>There are basically two supermarket options in Australia: Woolworths and Coles. In every suburb they&#8217;re within walking distance of each other so the decision of which to shop at usually falls to what you grew up with. Usually you&#8217;re a Coles person or a Woolworths person and the other just feels weird.</p>



<p>I grew up shopping at Woolworths and couldn&#8217;t imagine shopping at Coles. Until I did and really liked it for a number of reasons. The latest place I&#8217;m living sits exactly half way between a Woolworths and a Coles. For a couple of months I&#8217;ve been alternating between the two. These are my findings:</p>



<ul><li>Banks charge ridiculous fees for EFTPOS transactions. One way around it is to get a debit card and make EFTPOS transactions as though it&#8217;s a credit card. The money still comes out of your savings or checking account but the fee is moved from you to the retailer. Woolworths obviously weren&#8217;t happy about being charged a few cents every $100+ transaction so they stopped people doing it a few months ago. Coles still allows it just as almost every other store does. +1 Coles.</li>

<li>Woolworths have installed self service checkouts and dramatically reduced checkout staff numbers. The self service checkouts are a huge pain in the ass to use for anything but one or two items. Even at quiet times checking out at Woolworths involves standing in a long line. Coles are the opposite, they have no self service checkouts and lots of staff with usually no waiting in line at all. +1 Coles.</li>

<li>Coles has dedicated bicycle parking, Woolworths does not. +1 Coles.</li>

<li>The plastic produce bags at Coles are thick and never break. Woolworths are thin and often tear when removing them from the spindle or putting bananas in at the wrong angle. It&#8217;s small but it makes a difference. +1 Coles.</li>

<li>Coles have a special kind of small trolley that&#8217;s much bigger than a basket but smaller and raised higher than a regular trolley. For someone like me shopping for one it&#8217;s perfect, everything fits easily and I don&#8217;t need to bend all way over to fill and empty it. Woolworths just have small baskets and huge trollies. +1 Coles.</li>

<li>Woolworths have a rewards program and card. I realise that this is a blatant lock-in trap and that I&#8217;ll probably have to spend $10,000 before I get any kind of reward back but I have to buy food so I figure I may as well be accumulating <em>something</em>. Coles also have a program but it&#8217;s tied to a frequent flyer program for which I&#8217;ll rarely reap the benefits. +1 Woolworths.</li>

<li>Woolworths has spent money on creating a nice ambiance, the lighting is good, displays not too crass and the aisles are wide. Coles haven&#8217;t put the same work into ambiance. +1 Woolworths.</li>

<li>I can get everything I like at Woolworths, Coles is missing a number of things that I like. +1 Woolworths.</li>

</ul><p>The things Woolworths does at the expense of my time and money does not result in cheaper prices. I can barely tell the difference between the two in price. Coles is the clear winner but with its range issue for things I like it means I either need to make an additional trip to Woolworths each week or start eating differently.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote>And you&#8217;re seeing things like in the Melbourne bike hire scheme - it&#8217;s not working as well as it has in the rest of the world because people don&#8217;t walk around with a helmet just in case. You&#8217;ve got helmets creating a barrier to cycling, particularly spontaneous, short-trip cycling.</blockquote><p>Associate Professor Chris Rissel <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/08/16/2983587.htm">appealing for helmet laws to be scrapped</a>.</p>



<p>As someone who commutes exclusively by bike, trains and races a bike and has been <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/141205452">hit by a car</a> while riding a bike, I couldn&#8217;t agree more. Compulsory helmet laws are counter productive to cyclist safety.</p>



<p>The more cyclists on the road the more safe cycling infrastructure, the less motorists on the road, the more awareness of cyclists from motorists. The support for helmet laws seems to be from people who personally think cycling is very dangerous and wouldn&#8217;t go helmet-less themselves. A commenter on the article:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>I would not venture out on a bike without a helmet, given these road conditions. Australia needs a shift in attitude both towards the car and the bike before we can shed our helmet laws.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Repealing compulsory helmet laws <em>is</em> the shift in attitude Australia needs. The beauty of repealing the law is that if you want to wear a helmet, you can! I would certainly still wear a helmet during training rides and races but wouldn&#8217;t bother for the low speed, low traffic, extremely safe 1km ride to the shops or to a friend&#8217;s house.</p>



<p>The overwhelming evidence that no compulsory helmet laws dramatically encourage cycling and therefore make it safer is plain to see in countries like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-AbPav5E5M&amp;hd=1">the Netherlands</a> and Denmark.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m now half way through <a href="http://www.bignerdranch.com/book/cocoa%C2%AE_programming_for_mac%C2%AE_os_x_3rd_edition">Cocoa Programming for Mac OS X</a> and I&#8217;m still seriously struggling to get my head around things. So much in Cocoa seems to  happen by magic. Take this paragraph:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>You may now be saying, &#8220;Chapter 3 said that the designated initializer does all the work and calls the superclass&#8217;s designated initializer. It said that all other initializers call the designated initializer. But Person has an init method, which is its designated initializer, and this new initializer doesn&#8217;t call it.&#8221; You are right: initWithCoder: is an exception to initializer rules.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Now I had to re-read this about 5 times before I understood what it was saying but that aside, initWithCoder just happens to be an exception to initializer rules. Aaron Hillegass has pointed it out in this case but it feels like &#8220;this just does that, alright?&#8221; is the only explanation for too many things.</p>



<p>That coupled with the abstraction that happens in Interface Builder which is hidden once you return to Xcode makes it difficult for me to get my head around why things are happening or not happening.</p>



<p>Every new chapter I finish I&#8217;m further convinced I should just stick to web development. Hopefully a moment of clarity will come as I start messing around myself and try a range of learning materials.</p>
