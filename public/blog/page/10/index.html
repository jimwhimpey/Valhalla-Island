  <div class="entry-content"><img src="/assets/tumblr/tumblr_l8qhzgzlj61qzwfbio1_500.png"/><br/><p>The way iCal works is a perfect example of a real world metaphor being followed faithfully  to a fault. Calendars present whole calendar months because they don&#8217;t know what day it is, your computer does and it should take advantage of that knowledge.</p>



<p>In this case it&#8217;s the middle of the month and I want to see what&#8217;s happening early next next month <em>in the context of today</em>. Hit the arrow button and you&#8217;re in the next month without context. It&#8217;s impossible to see four weeks ahead of the current day in the same view yet I&#8217;m being shown two weeks of events in the past which I no longer care about at all.</p>



<p>I think I&#8217;ve been frustrated by and blogged about this at least four times over the past five years. Surely someone has fixed this problem?</p>

This was perfectly demonstrated with the release of iTunes 10, its terrible icon and <a href="http://www.iconpaper.org/category/mac/icons/">the slew of replacement options</a> created in the days following.</p>



<p>Unfortunately I&#8217;ve never seen a more uninspired group of alternatives. Every one of them is at most a slight variation, keeping or even exacerbating the worst parts of the original.</p>

I must have spent almost every dollar I earnt as a teenager on those CDs. In the end I got back about 1/24th of what I originally paid retail. Dying media, eh?</p>



<p>Anyway, I&#8217;ve recently been reading Our Choice by Al Gore, a big heavy book in an almost square shape with textbook-like thick paper and a soft cover. This thing is frustratingly difficult to read and has prompted me to buy a Kindle. To finance the purchase I&#8217;m getting rid of the few books I&#8217;ve acquired over the years that I know I&#8217;ll never read again or that I can buy again as Kindle books, i.e. all of them.</p>



<p>To help my get rid of them I&#8217;ve made a website: <a href="http://jimsbooksale.heroku.com/">jimsbooksale.heroku.com</a> It&#8217;s a Sinatra app with DataMapper interfacing a PostGre database running on <a href="http://heroku.com/">Heroku</a>. The whole thing took about 10 hours from start to finish and I&#8217;m once again blown away by how easy and what a joy it is to make things with this stack.</p>



<p>Unless you live in the inner Brisbane suburbs and can pick it up it&#8217;s probably not worth your while requesting anything but if you want a number of books let me know and I can organise shipping.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>There are basically two supermarket options in Australia: Woolworths and Coles. In every suburb they&#8217;re within walking distance of each other so the decision of which to shop at usually falls to what you grew up with. Usually you&#8217;re a Coles person or a Woolworths person and the other just feels weird.</p>



<p>I grew up shopping at Woolworths and couldn&#8217;t imagine shopping at Coles. Until I did and really liked it for a number of reasons. The latest place I&#8217;m living sits exactly half way between a Woolworths and a Coles. For a couple of months I&#8217;ve been alternating between the two. These are my findings:</p>



<ul><li>Banks charge ridiculous fees for EFTPOS transactions. One way around it is to get a debit card and make EFTPOS transactions as though it&#8217;s a credit card. The money still comes out of your savings or checking account but the fee is moved from you to the retailer. Woolworths obviously weren&#8217;t happy about being charged a few cents every $100+ transaction so they stopped people doing it a few months ago. Coles still allows it just as almost every other store does. +1 Coles.</li>

<li>Woolworths have installed self service checkouts and dramatically reduced checkout staff numbers. The self service checkouts are a huge pain in the ass to use for anything but one or two items. Even at quiet times checking out at Woolworths involves standing in a long line. Coles are the opposite, they have no self service checkouts and lots of staff with usually no waiting in line at all. +1 Coles.</li>

<li>Coles has dedicated bicycle parking, Woolworths does not. +1 Coles.</li>

<li>The plastic produce bags at Coles are thick and never break. Woolworths are thin and often tear when removing them from the spindle or putting bananas in at the wrong angle. It&#8217;s small but it makes a difference. +1 Coles.</li>

<li>Coles have a special kind of small trolley that&#8217;s much bigger than a basket but smaller and raised higher than a regular trolley. For someone like me shopping for one it&#8217;s perfect, everything fits easily and I don&#8217;t need to bend all way over to fill and empty it. Woolworths just have small baskets and huge trollies. +1 Coles.</li>

<li>Woolworths have a rewards program and card. I realise that this is a blatant lock-in trap and that I&#8217;ll probably have to spend $10,000 before I get any kind of reward back but I have to buy food so I figure I may as well be accumulating <em>something</em>. Coles also have a program but it&#8217;s tied to a frequent flyer program for which I&#8217;ll rarely reap the benefits. +1 Woolworths.</li>

<li>Woolworths has spent money on creating a nice ambiance, the lighting is good, displays not too crass and the aisles are wide. Coles haven&#8217;t put the same work into ambiance. +1 Woolworths.</li>

<li>I can get everything I like at Woolworths, Coles is missing a number of things that I like. +1 Woolworths.</li>

</ul><p>The things Woolworths does at the expense of my time and money does not result in cheaper prices. I can barely tell the difference between the two in price. Coles is the clear winner but with its range issue for things I like it means I either need to make an additional trip to Woolworths each week or start eating differently.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote>And you&#8217;re seeing things like in the Melbourne bike hire scheme - it&#8217;s not working as well as it has in the rest of the world because people don&#8217;t walk around with a helmet just in case. You&#8217;ve got helmets creating a barrier to cycling, particularly spontaneous, short-trip cycling.</blockquote><p>Associate Professor Chris Rissel <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/08/16/2983587.htm">appealing for helmet laws to be scrapped</a>.</p>



<p>As someone who commutes exclusively by bike, trains and races a bike and has been <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/141205452">hit by a car</a> while riding a bike, I couldn&#8217;t agree more. Compulsory helmet laws are counter productive to cyclist safety.</p>



<p>The more cyclists on the road the more safe cycling infrastructure, the less motorists on the road, the more awareness of cyclists from motorists. The support for helmet laws seems to be from people who personally think cycling is very dangerous and wouldn&#8217;t go helmet-less themselves. A commenter on the article:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>I would not venture out on a bike without a helmet, given these road conditions. Australia needs a shift in attitude both towards the car and the bike before we can shed our helmet laws.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Repealing compulsory helmet laws <em>is</em> the shift in attitude Australia needs. The beauty of repealing the law is that if you want to wear a helmet, you can! I would certainly still wear a helmet during training rides and races but wouldn&#8217;t bother for the low speed, low traffic, extremely safe 1km ride to the shops or to a friend&#8217;s house.</p>



<p>The overwhelming evidence that no compulsory helmet laws dramatically encourage cycling and therefore make it safer is plain to see in countries like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-AbPav5E5M&amp;hd=1">the Netherlands</a> and Denmark.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m now half way through <a href="http://www.bignerdranch.com/book/cocoa%C2%AE_programming_for_mac%C2%AE_os_x_3rd_edition">Cocoa Programming for Mac OS X</a> and I&#8217;m still seriously struggling to get my head around things. So much in Cocoa seems to  happen by magic. Take this paragraph:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>You may now be saying, &#8220;Chapter 3 said that the designated initializer does all the work and calls the superclass&#8217;s designated initializer. It said that all other initializers call the designated initializer. But Person has an init method, which is its designated initializer, and this new initializer doesn&#8217;t call it.&#8221; You are right: initWithCoder: is an exception to initializer rules.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Now I had to re-read this about 5 times before I understood what it was saying but that aside, initWithCoder just happens to be an exception to initializer rules. Aaron Hillegass has pointed it out in this case but it feels like &#8220;this just does that, alright?&#8221; is the only explanation for too many things.</p>



<p>That coupled with the abstraction that happens in Interface Builder which is hidden once you return to Xcode makes it difficult for me to get my head around why things are happening or not happening.</p>



<p>Every new chapter I finish I&#8217;m further convinced I should just stick to web development. Hopefully a moment of clarity will come as I start messing around myself and try a range of learning materials.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.farbeyondthestars.com/57-things/">The Less You Have, The More Epic Your Life</a></p><p>Everett Bogue owns just 57 things. After reading the list you might wonder how he brushes his teeth, washes himself or his clothes, cooks food, cleans his accommodation, where he sits, what he sleeps on, how he keeps food frozen, what he eats from or with or how he pumps up his bike tyres.</p>



<p>The answer to a lot of those questions seems to be he lives with someone and they obviously have a lot of shared items that facilitate these necessities of life. I&#8217;d say that invalidates the 57 things count but maybe, like the underwear disclaimer, it&#8217;s one of the unspoken rules of the minimalist blogger:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>I’m counting my underwear and socks together because every other minimalist blogger does too. We’re allowed to cheat on undergarments because we always have.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Irrefutable logic.</p>



<p>Pretend for a minute that he really only has 57 things in the way it&#8217;s being sold. As I&#8217;ve <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/160357037">written before</a>, simplicity not minimalism should be the goal. There is no inherent good in minimalism. Owning a toothbrush is not a burden <em>plus</em> it makes it very easy to brush my teeth when the time comes twice a day.</p>



<p>As with many things Bike Snob <a href="http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2010/08/new-smugness-keeping-it-to-minimum.html">sums it up</a> using minimal words:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>[…] at what point is the effort involved ultimately less simple than simply having the stuff?</p>

<ul><li>The centrepiece of the page is stock photography.</li>

<li>&#8220;Working hard&#8221; is one of their selling points.</li>

<li>&#8220;Macs can take time to learn&#8221;.</li>

<li>Lots of &#8220;mays&#8221; and &#8220;mights&#8221;. Nothing substantiated, just planting seeds of doubt.</li>

</ul><p>The difference in each campaign embodies the difference in each company on the whole. Apple sell the Mac&#8217;s advantages, Microsoft sell the Mac&#8217;s potential disadvantages. Offence vs. defence.</p>



<p>Beside that, the whole thing is just full of inaccuracies or exaggerations designed to scare:</p>



<ul><li>&#8220;And Macs can&#8217;t connect to an Xbox 360&#8221;. I connect to my Xbox from my iMac almost daily.</li>

<li>&#8221;[&#8230;] the mouse works differently&#8221;. Not true.</li>

<li>&#8220;With a Mac, it&#8217;s harder to set up secure sharing for your photos, music &amp; movies, documents, and even printers with other computers on your home network.&#8221; Not true.</li>

<li>&#8220;On a Mac, you have to manually set up photo sharing, manually set up music and movie sharing, manually set up file sharing, and manually set up printer sharing.&#8221; That&#8217;s true, each involves clicking a check box.</li>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>A week in the life of many I see every Saturday morning:</p>



<ol><li>Always take the lift instead of the stairs.</li>

<li>Treat escalators like rides.</li>

<li>Watch 3 hours of TV each evening.</li>

<li>Drive <em>everywhere</em>, even the shortest of distances.</li>

<li>Join a group of 10 others on Saturday morning to attend a $20, 1 hour bootcamp involving relentless, unpleasant physical activity while being yelled at by a personal trainer.</li>

<li>Suffer an injury.</li>

<li>Sore all over, spend the next five days doing nothing while you recover.</li>

<li>Associate exercise with terrible things, resent it.</li>

</ol><p>Exercise needs to be a part of life. It doesn&#8217;t work as a chore you do to top up your fitness every couple of weeks. When it is treated that way with things like boot camps the negatives it produces in the form of injuries, exhaustion for days and negative connotations with exercise totally outweigh any benefit from a one hour workout.</p>



<p>Keeping fit and healthy is simple: find a physical activity you love. For me it&#8217;s cycling, for you it could be tennis, swimming, rowing, boxing, skipping, dancing or walking though the park. The physical benefits become a side effect of something you love doing in any case.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Bike Snob, as he does so often, strikes to the heart of an issue with casual cycling parlance. Here on a big <a href="http://travel.nytimes.com/2010/08/01/travel/01Biking.html?pagewanted=1&amp;src=twt&amp;twt=nytimes">bicycle tour &#8220;holiday&#8221; through the desert</a>:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Ideally, we would not need such vacations, instead weaving strands of responsibility and pleasure into the laterally stiff yet vertically compliant crabon fribé of a balanced life.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>This is the way I feel about all holidays. One recurring memory from my childhood is my Mum working her butt off (and getting appropriately stressed) to have everything organised in time for us to take a holiday.</p>



<p>In my year and a half of working full time I&#8217;ve taken very little leave and almost none in big blocks. Yet I&#8217;ve never felt overworked, stressed or like I need to take a holiday. I work sane hours and lead a rich life outside of work. Everyone is doing it wrong.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>From Adam Quigley&#8217;s <a href="http://www.alwayswatching.net/features/lost-sucks">fantastic, detailed look back</a> on six years of Lost after seeing the final episode:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>&#8220;Across the Sea&#8221;, the Jacob/Man in Black flashback episode, is the break-up.</p>

  

  <p>For some, I suspect the series finale was the make-up sex.</p>

  

  <p>For me, the series finale was like being forced to watch my six-year lover blow another guy.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>For me it was make up sex followed by an empty feeling a couple of days after I&#8217;d realised what I&#8217;d done. Nonetheless, a bad breakup doesn&#8217;t nullify 6 years of good times.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.marco.org/868606627">Marco Arment</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p>Today’s overdue Mac Pro update is a welcome change, but for a computer that’s so expensive, why not just get an iMac?</p></blockquote>



<p>This is exactly the question I faced when upgrading to my current computer, a low specced 27&#8221; iMac. Three things weighed most heavily into my decision:</p>



<ul><li>A lowest end Mac Pro plus a cinema display is <em>way more</em> expensive than a lowest end iMac. The higher the specs on each model the lower the margin but I have no need for extreme performance.</li>

<li>Six months ago you couldn&#8217;t buy a 27&#8221; LED display outside of an iMac.</li>

<li>Unlike previous generation iMacs and thanks to the wonders of DisplayPort I can use use the iMac&#8217;s display as an external display for a Mac Pro in the future.</li>

</ul><p>So come 6 or 12 months when my low specced iMac starts to feel unbearably slow I&#8217;ll buy a Mac Pro and reap the benefits Marco lists while keeping the most valuable part of the iMac. There&#8217;ll be a computer sitting on the back of the iMac not doing anything but that&#8217;s a small write off.</p>
