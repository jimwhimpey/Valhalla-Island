  <div class="entry-content"><p>Having recently <em>invested</em> in a Nikon D90 and being in the middle of a small holiday there&#8217;s a thick stream of photos dropping into the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jimwhimpey/">Flickr account</a> I&#8217;ve paid for and used on and off for almost 5 years.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s a lot to love about Flickr but again the antiquated 5 year old design and slow navigation is frustrating me. I upload huge files out of Aperture yet there&#8217;s <em>no way</em> to directly browse between photos at anything larger than 500px wide. Even that is an excruciatingly slow process with a full, heavy page reload required for each image.</p>



<p>Facebook, who don&#8217;t even store high resolution versions of images, have a much larger default browsing size and lighting fast navigation via keyboard and mouse.</p>



<p><a href="http://ihardlyknowher.com/">I Hardly Know Her</a> tries to address the issues but falls short with no way to force set views to show a larger size by default and omitting the title and caption, even from the meta data shown on mouse over. I&#8217;m all for the hiding by default but why omit the title and caption while including stuff like the aperture and shutter speed? Technical details few care about and remain a click away for those that do.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This year I managed to land a huge amount of presents, most of them books. Despite my excitement about reading them I can&#8217;t help but feel that acquiring new books in 2009 is like building a fantastic HD-DVD library. The fact remains that books are simply the best way to read text. Although I haven&#8217;t tried a Kindle, I&#8217;d love it to prove even better.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I love Andre Torrez&#8217;s <a href="http://notes.torrez.org/2009/12/resolutions-2010.html">new year&#8217;s resolution idea</a>:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>So then it hit me: what if I only listened to music released in 2010? Okay.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>As much as the thought of not listening to my favourite music for a year sucks, my entire library feels stale. Despite the magic of <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/fightingfriends">last.fm</a> and iTunes Genius I struggle to find new music I like.</p>



<p>The idea of forcing yourself to actively search for new things to like really appeals to me. It&#8217;s too easy to get stuck in a comfortable bubble, endeavours like this push you out.</p>



<p>As it stands I&#8217;m over the moon when I hear a favourite song that I haven&#8217;t personally cued up. I imagine this effect would be amplified many times over when you haven&#8217;t heard any of your old favourites in months. I&#8217;d get excited again with the anticipation of a new realise from a favourite band. At the end of it all you&#8217;ve got a brand new set of artists you enjoy and songs you&#8217;d listened to over 100 times in the preceding years would feel fresh again. It&#8217;s a fantastic idea.</p>



<p>I make a point of only making a single resolution each year. I&#8217;ve got a week and a bit to think about whether this&#8217;ll be it.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Every week I listen to <a href="http://thislife.org/">This American Life</a> plead for donations from its hundreds of thousands of podcast listeners. They remind us that producing and getting the show out to so many people is very expensive and they need donations to survive. If you enjoy the show, <em>donate</em>, they say.</p>



<p>It seems to me that there is a very simple answer to what seems to be an increasingly dire financial situation This American Life has found themselves in: charge for the podcast.</p>



<p>When I first discovered the show I couldn&#8217;t get enough. The only way to get more than one episode a week was to use the crappy flash player on their website or buy episodes as audio books from iTunes for $2 a piece. I bought at least 20 episodes when the alternatives were a totally free, mildly inconvenient player or simply <em>waiting</em>.</p>



<p>Charge for it. Rather than plead with people to support something they love, <em>force them to</em>. Even if they lost 80% of their podcast listeners, the still huge amount of remaining listeners will continue to enjoy the show (without the begging) and This American Life becomes financially secure.</p>



<p>But of course this is coming from a country which is perfectly comfortable in its complicated, equivocal system of tipping to support service industry staff rather than simply charging more and paying them more.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Every Mac blog I used to follow for their insightful computer and software analysis and opinion has now diverted almost their entire attention to, in this order, mobile phones in general, App Store criticism, AT&amp;T, Verizon and the iPhone.</p>



<p>It sucks.</p>



<p>I like my iPhone and it&#8217;s certainly a useful, informative and enjoyable upgrade from my old phone. I believe it&#8217;s the best mobile phone available by a long shot. That&#8217;s where my interest in all mobile phones and mobile phone infrastructure ends. My carrier in Australia, Optus, isn&#8217;t fantastic and I barely care about <em>that</em>, let alone what sounds like an equally not perfect carrier in AT&amp;T, <em>let alone the rival to AT&amp;T</em>.</p>



<p>As for the App Store, the apps I use regularly, Instapaper, Tumblr and Tweetie were available for me to purchase in the store and I enjoy them. Updates take a while to come through the system and as a consumer, the one forking out money, I don&#8217;t care. My iPhone is a secondary device, if I lost my phone for a week it wouldn&#8217;t be a huge deal, I can wait a while for a bug to be fixed in an application I use 1 hour total per week while I sit on the train.</p>



<p>I used to pore over every word written at <a href="http://daringfireball.net/">Daring Fireball</a> but now I find myself completely skipping the majority of posts.</p>



<p>The obsession has moved so far beyond the iPhone and into everything however remotely connected to it. An app is forced to have a 17+ rating, HTC releases a new phone, Verizon run an ad campaign, Google releases a phone, HTC releases another phone. As far as I&#8217;m concerned it&#8217;s the equivalent of writing in depth about every shitty new laptop Dell releases. I&#8217;m sad to have lost some of my favourite writing to a topic I care so little about.</p>

	        <h2 class="entry-title">GPS Cycling Tracking Software Options Review</h2>
	      
			
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Before I got my <a href="https://buy.garmin.com/shop/shop.do?pID=10885">Garmin Edge 705</a> I was using the iPhone + <a href="http://runkeeper.com/">RunKeeper</a> combo. RunKeeper was for simply tracking the distances I was riding before I had a bike computer rather than for any kind of analysis. I get much more data out of the Garmin and it&#8217;s lead me head first into a category of software I hadn&#8217;t previously explored.</p>



<p>The options are numerous both online and client side but each have their own sets of positives, negatives and quirks. I&#8217;ll attempt to summarise my findings over the last week.</p>



<h3><a href="http://runkeeper.com/">RunKeeper</a></h3>



<p>The website presents the relatively small amount of data RunKeeper collects well. Every other app here has features that stretch beyond what RunKeeper&#8217;s can provide. If all you have is an iPhone this is without a doubt the way to go.</p>



<p><strong>Positives</strong></p>



<ul><li>Great graph and map integration. Hover over the graph and it shows you the point on the map.</li>

<li>Great looking, readable graphs.</li>

<li>Good presentation of summary data like total distance, average speed, etc.</li>

<li>No need to upload anything, taken care of by the iPhone app.</li>

<li>Nice simple date based method of managing rides.</li>

<li>Being web based, easy to share.</li>

</ul><p><strong>Negatives</strong></p>



<ul><li>Inflexible. Small map that you can&#8217;t make bigger without hiding the graph.</li>

<li>Bad map presentation, in Map view it&#8217;s difficult to make out the path.</li>

<li>You have to use an iPhone. This is the biggest negative. Starting, stopping and pausing is cumbersome as the phone is in a pocket and often in a protective bag. The GPS also churns through the battery, it&#8217;ll completely drain on a 3 hour ride.</li>

</ul><h3><a href="http://connect.garmin.com/">Garmin Connect</a></h3>



<p>I was wary of Garmin Connect. Their client side software <em>sucks</em> and I thought Connect would be not much more than a bullet point on Garmin product&#8217;s feature lists. My concern was unfounded, Connect is highly polished and functional. I&#8217;d go as far to say it&#8217;s one of the better web applications out there.</p>



<p><strong>Positives</strong></p>



<ul><li>Good looking website that&#8217;s all round, easy to use and navigate.</li>

<li>Attractive, readable graphs.</li>

<li>Easy to get data from your device to Connect with their totally unobtrusive browser plugin.</li>

<li>Simple and useful reporting UI.</li>

<li>Being web based, easy to share.</li>

</ul><p><strong>Negatives</strong></p>



<ul><li>No map to graph interaction outside of a cumbersome Flash &#8220;player&#8221;.</li>

<li>No ability to layer graphs or compare rides.</li>

<li>Somewhat inflexible, you can&#8217;t enlarge the map or graphs.</li>

</ul><h3><a href="http://www.rubitrack.com/">Rubitrack</a></h3>



<p>Rubitrack is well put together and organised, a major advantage. UI conventions are followed and everything works the way you expect it to. The source list works like a contextual bunch of smart folders and it&#8217;s my favourite way any of these applications organise rides. But while it does some things brilliantly, it does others poorly.</p>



<p><strong>Positives</strong></p>



<ul><li>Well organised, Mac like UI.</li>

<li>Crystal clear map that visually represents zones.</li>

</ul><p><strong>Negatives</strong></p>



<ul><li>Crappy graphs in many ways. No interaction with the map, visually confusing and doesn&#8217;t display precise readings on hover. In practice, they&#8217;re static jpegs.</li>

<li>Forces you to save and maintain a library <em>file</em> which it doesn&#8217;t automatically load on next open. I hate this convention. When I&#8217;m using an application to interact with a &#8220;library&#8221; of something, I don&#8217;t want to manage afile, I don&#8217;t want to save or open, I want the data side of things to be invisible. I can&#8217;t think of any situation where I&#8217;d want to manage multiple Rubitrack libraries simultaneously.</li>

<li>The calendar view has potential but is poorly executed.</li>

</ul><h3><a href="http://trailrunnerx.com/">TrailRunner</a></h3>



<p>For donationware TrailRunner is surprisingly good but tries to be too much at the expense of absolutely nailing what it already does well. In some areas it&#8217;s polished to perfection, in others it almost seems broken.</p>



<p><strong>Positives</strong></p>



<ul><li>The best looking graphs of any of the applications listed here. Far and away the most well thought out and executed. Very easy to read layered graphs.</li>

<li>Ability to select a section of the graph which it will then display averages for and display that selection on the map. A brilliant idea that no other app has implemented let alone done so well.</li>

<li>Great looking maps and seamless graph + map integration.</li>

</ul><p><strong>Negatives</strong></p>



<ul><li>Disorganised UI. Sometimes I will get lost and don&#8217;t know how to get back to my list of rides. Labels are messy and unclear.</li>

<li>Some functions popup confusing windows which aren&#8217;t obvious how they integrate into the rest of the application.</li>

<li>Ugly, annoying copyright banner on the bottom of the map. I assume this is a requirement for map use without a commercial license but it&#8217;s distracting.</li>

<li>The same frustrating save file model as Rubitrack.</li>

</ul><h3><a href="http://www.montebellosoftware.com/index.html">Ascent</a></h3>



<p>Ascent is the Final Cut Pro of this category of applications. Raw UI with every kind of function at your disposal. The UI is just plain ugly and acts strangely, drop down buttons act like toggle switches and new windows are opened all over the place. It&#8217;s a powerful application but I can&#8217;t look past the unpolished UI.</p>



<p><strong>Positives</strong></p>



<ul><li>The option to dim the map background results in the best looking maps out of any application here.</li>

<li>There&#8217;s a great map view that shows your zones along the route. I don&#8217;t understand why this isn&#8217;t the default.</li>

</ul><p><strong>Negatives</strong></p>



<ul><li>Map and graph interaction is only possible when you have the graph popup open even though a graph exists as part of the main window.</li>

<li><em>Again</em>, Ascent forces you to manage library files! Why do they do this?! Could you imagine having to manually save your iTunes library every time you added a song to a playlist or change the smallest piece of meta data.</li>

<li>I simply can&#8217;t tolerate the interface and interaction quirks. There&#8217;s one text box which <em>opens up a modal text box</em> when it gains focus. Frustrating to use.</li>

</ul><h3><a href="http://www.garmin.com/garmin/cms/us/intosports/training_center">Garmin Training Center</a></h3>



<p>Granted it&#8217;s a &#8220;beta&#8221; but Garmin Training Center is too bad to dwell on. Don&#8217;t waste your time.</p>



<h3>Conclusion</h3>



<p>There is definitely no clear winner. All the client side options have the requirement for saving library files which pisses me off so much it&#8217;s a deal breaker across the board. Although each of them have their own individual pitfalls outside of the file issue. For now I&#8217;m sticking with Garmin Connect, although it lacks some features, it makes up for it by doing what it does do well. The UI is polished and and great reporting tools which I appreciate.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve looked into the files that my Garmin Edge collects and they&#8217;re nothing more than simple XML files which opens it up for me to play with this data myself. I had a great time creating the graph on <a href="http://ride.jimwhimpey.com">ride.jimwhimpey.com</a> with <a href="http://raphaeljs.com/">Raphael</a>, so I&#8217;m looking forward to diving into my cycling data with <a href="http://g.raphaeljs.com/">Graphael</a> and perhaps complimenting Garmin Connect with my own software.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Initially Stuff You Should Know sounded right up my alley. Unfortunately it is not what I hoped it would be: the concise distillation of interesting information organised into a tight presentation. Instead it&#8217;s two dudes having a long-winded, ragtag chat about the topic. There&#8217;s moments of good stuff but what could be a great 10 minute show is 30 minutes of mostly blather between a pair of bros.</p>

After following the unsubscribe link from one of their spam newsletters you have to enter your email so they can <em>send you another email</em> you can use to unsubscribe. It&#8217;s incredible that whoever devised this system failed to see the irony.</p>



<p>Then I find out that if I&#8217;m only using their dashboard widget and therefore not giving them money, I <em>can&#8217;t</em> unsubscribe at all. Fuck you IceTV.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I refuse to believe that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gruen_transfer">Gruen Transfer</a> helps retail in any way. The kind of store that tends to stock the clothes I like, department stores, are notoriously the most &#8220;effective&#8221; implementors of the Gruen Transfer.</p>



<p>They scatter their clothes throughout a huge area. Shorts, T-shirts, collared shirts and jackets are all dispersed over 50mÂ². It&#8217;s impossible to compare the range and you&#8217;re forced to walk around.</p>



<p>When you finally find the clothes you want, you then have to find where to pay for it.</p>



<p>Surely frustrating your shoppers by forcing them to search for similar items and a place to pay for them couldn&#8217;t possibly outweigh helping shoppers find what they want and pay for it as efficiently as possible.</p>



<p>I imagine department store executives: <em>&#8220;I know! We&#8217;ll disorient our customers, make it difficult to browse our entire range and force them search for the place where they give us their money!&#8221;</em></p>
