  <div class="entry-content"><p>Years ago I read about the elegance and simplicity of Ruby on Rails and couldn&#8217;t wait to try it out but each of the few times I tried to dive in the following year I was overwhelmed by convention I didn&#8217;t understand and abandoned the idea.</p>



<p>When recently in Sydney I told <a href="http://toolmantim.com/">toolmantim</a> about my failed attempts using Rails and he told me about <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a>, the lightweight Ruby web framework which sounded like what I had originally hoped Rails would be.</p>



<p>Just two weeks ago I started <a href="http://darkroom.heroku.com/">Darkroom</a> in my spare time with no experience writing Ruby. Today it&#8217;s basically complete: a big Flickr slideshow presentation!</p>



<p>See it in action with <a href="http://darkroom.heroku.com/photos/Wolfgang+Bartelme/sets/72157622707212478">this gorgeous set of nature photos</a> by Wolfgang Bartelme or <a href="http://darkroom.heroku.com/photos/Jorge+Quinteros">Jorge Quinteros&#8217;s photostream</a>.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s even a bookmarklet for redirecting Flickr URLs to Darkroom URLs!</p>



<p>The idea was born from my frustration with Flickr&#8217;s 500px wide default with no way to navigate between photos and anything larger outside the Flash slideshow. <a href="http://ihardlyknowher.com/">I Hardly Know Her</a> tackled the same issue but falls short, defaulting to a smaller size and not offering titles or descriptions.</p>



<p>Sinatra has built in support for <a href="http://haml-lang.com/">HAML</a> and <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a> two more tools I&#8217;ve wanted to try for a while. They&#8217;re both a joy. Writing vanilla HTML and CSS feels like running in soft sand. I&#8217;m planning to convert almost every web property I have to Sinatra if only for the effortless HAML and SASS support.</p>



<p>The last piece of the puzzle is deployment with <a href="http://heroku.com/">Heroku</a>, a process which is nothing short of magic. From start to finish the combination of Sinatra, HAML, SASS and Heroku is the kind of elegance and simplicity that I&#8217;d always hoped Ruby on Rails was.</p>

<ol><li>It&#8217;s now totally free for everyone.</li>

</ol><p>It&#8217;s free in the hope of building a user base. The API uses secure OAuth authentication and makes every read/write method available to developers. The API documentation isn&#8217;t yet complete but there&#8217;s enough to get you started.</p>



<p>The entire front end has been redesigned, including <a href="http://getcampusnotes.com/jimwhimpey/214-welcome">shared notes</a> and there&#8217;s a few nice new features in the back end like the ability to inline embed attached images.</p>

<p>This saddens me. I love the iPhone and assume I&#8217;ll love the iPad but they are great almost only for consuming. The market of consumers is obviously much larger than that of creators but it&#8217;s a shame development of the consumer&#8217;s device and software has to come at the expense of the creator&#8217;s.</p>

<p>The whole thing feels weird to me. Why would Loren Brichter abandon his massively successful independently run <a href="http://www.atebits.com/">business</a>, the freedom and control that comes with it to be another cog in the Twitter machine? It&#8217;d be a different story if Tweetie was languishing in obscurity but it&#8217;s got to be the most popular Twitter  iPhone <em>and</em> Mac client. I guess they gave him a bag of money too big to refuse.</p>



<p>It&#8217;ll be interesting to see what happens to Tweetie for Mac, my favourite Twitter desktop client.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There is a high end restaurant that sits literally over the river not far from where I live. I have no idea how it got the position, there&#8217;s no other business anywhere near the bank of the river 5km in either direction. They&#8217;re quite famous in Brisbane for their location and apparently the food is pretty good, albeit expensive.</p>



<p>They recently attached a platform jetty off the main restaurant building, filled it with tables and opened it as a fish and chip shop. This pleased me because there&#8217;s no other fish and chip shop within walking distance and I liked the idea walking along the river before eating on the water.</p>



<p>I picked up a menu next time I passed, found that the cheapest item available was $15 and wrote off the idea forever.</p>



<p>It sits right on the bikeway that runs into the city and I pass this place often. From the bikeway you can see the every table on the jetty. In the three months or so it&#8217;s been open I have seen <em>one</em> person eating there.</p>



<p>One month into the opening they must have got sick of putting out and putting away a full set of tables for next to no customers so they started putting out only three tables. This meant only about 25% of the jetty was used and it looked ridiculous. Still no one ate there.</p>



<p>A month later I guess they realised how pathetic it looked to have a jetty with only three unoccupied tables and they switched back to the full compliment of unoccupied tables. Since then I still don&#8217;t see anyone eating there.</p>

	        <h2 class="entry-title">Carfree Cities</h2>
	      
			
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>On the eve of the opening of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clem_Jones_Tunnel">CLEM7</a>, a $3.2 billion automobile underground tunnel made to ease Brisbane&#8217;s heavy traffic congestion, I finished reading <a href="http://www.carfree.com/">Carfree Cities</a>.</p>



<p>In it J.H. Crawford advocates the benefits of carfree cities <em>and</em> provides a significantly detailed reference design for how one could build a carfree city or convert an existing city to the carfree design. It&#8217;s a deeply thought-out, flexible concept grounded in hard geometry and proven technology, not pie in the sky dreaming.</p>



<p>The motivation for Crawford&#8217;s proposition is not in environmentalism (although it is a pleasant side effect) but in quality of life. The book is focused on visually pleasing surroundings, safe environments, low noise, vibrant atmosphere, fast convenient transport, clean air and a strong communities. This is the brilliance of Carfree Cities. While anyone will argue that something as personally distant as pollution is a small price to pay for the (perceived) convenience of cars, it&#8217;s hard to argue against your own quality of life.</p>



<p>Cars certainly have a place in the world, there is little other feasible option for long distance travel to remote areas. But in cities they are nothing short of destructive.</p>



<p>Cars are isolating. You&#8217;re literally moving around the world in a bubble. It&#8217;s often completely impossible to interact with a good friend while travelling in a car, even if you have both seen each other and are travelling slowly. Chance encounters are rare in a car centric city.</p>



<p>They kill street life. Wide, loud, smelly, dangerous streets are skirted by car parking which only then buildings sit behind. Many city buildings are primarily accessible only through an attached parking garage. The street is only a means to get from car to building with no life of its own.</p>



<p>Think of the vibrant street life in areas of a city where cars are excluded. Brisbane&#8217;s South Bank or any pedestrian mall or square in most of the world&#8217;s capitals cities are good examples. People flock to these areas, the atmosphere is lively and inviting. There&#8217;s little reason entire cities shouldn&#8217;t share the same ambiance.</p>



<p>Cars are just plain dangerous. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_motor_vehicle_deaths_in_U.S._by_year">Tens of thousands of people</a> die at the hands of the automobile every year. If the same number of people were killed by anything else it&#8217;d be considered an epidemic.</p>



<p>Beyond their community and <em>person</em> killing qualities, cars are unsustainable, grossly inefficient, expensive and with the time spent in traffic jams, living further from amenities and the search for car parking, offer no added convenience.</p>



<p>For over a year I&#8217;ve been car-free in a car centric city for health, financial and environmental reasons. It works for me but besides the occasional frustration with poor public transport or inadequate bicycle facilities I had spent little time thinking about the widespread benefits that a carfree city could provide.</p>



<p>My eyes have been been opened and I now find myself resenting the car, the negative trends it fosters and the relentless support of it by legislators. If a city was created based on any permutation of the reference design in Carfree Cities I would do everything I could to move my life there.</p>

It was going to work exactly the same way, a vertically mounted LCD presenting an HTML page. I was really excited about it but unfortunately it fell by the wayside as more pressing issues (that is, news events) presented themselves.</p>
