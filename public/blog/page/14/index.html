<p>No penalty is too harsh for the damage riders like Vinokourov have done to cycling&#8217;s reputation. He deserved a lifetime ban and as far as I&#8217;m concerned he didn&#8217;t win last night.</p>

Occasionally, Robic leaps from his bike to square off with shadowy figures that turn out to be mailboxes.

<p>When I was doing a lot of running and swimming, at the end of a long run I would get a mild case of these kind of things. I&#8217;d mistake inanimate things for animals or people: a shrub could be a dog, a tree trunk could be a gardener but I&#8217;d immediately snap out of it. It was that or a state of semi detachment which was really quite a nice feeling, snapping out of that would feel like waking up.</p>

	        <h2 class="entry-title">More Thoughts on the Nissan Leaf</h2>
	      
			
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>The car rather than <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/540208616">the website</a> this time. Starting with the facts:</p>



<ul><li>It gets 100 miles per charge.</li>

<li>Charging requires a home installed charging station.</li>

</ul><p>The site fails to mention how long it takes to recharge which makes me assume it comes no where near rivalling a 10 minute petrol fill up. I&#8217;m guessing it requires an overnight charge. So even if there were public recharge stations and you want to be able to get home, the leaf&#8217;s effective range is 50 miles.</p>



<p>There is one scenario to which cars are perfectly suited: long distance travel to remote locations. Places to which operating public transport is not and will never be feasible or sensible. Short range electric cars like the Leaf are competitors to public transport, car sharing schemes, walking and bicycling within cities.</p>



<p>Cars in cities, electric or otherwise, are the problem. If you live in a sufficiently densely populated area where any conceivable destination is within 50 miles public transport is feasible and should be the solution.</p>



<p>It reminds me of &#8220;urban transport devices&#8221; like the Segway and the <a href="http://www.yikebike.com/">YikeBike</a>. They&#8217;re competing with <em>walking</em> and riding a bike. There&#8217;s no problem they&#8217;re solving.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is an interesting car with an interesting website.</p>



<p>After sitting through the intro animation and navigating around for a few moments you might find yourself frustrated by the gratuitous animation and strange abstract menu structure with tiny hit areas. All the stuff usually found in Flash websites made by people unconvinced HTML could possibly provide the platform this breakthrough product deserves.</p>



<p>But aside from the opening animation the Nissan Leaf&#8217;s website <em>is</em> HTML.</p>



<p>Which is impressive.</p>



<p>The same way <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvL89EpoLNQ">squirting milk out of an eye socket</a> is impressive.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Years ago I read about the elegance and simplicity of Ruby on Rails and couldn&#8217;t wait to try it out but each of the few times I tried to dive in the following year I was overwhelmed by convention I didn&#8217;t understand and abandoned the idea.</p>



<p>When recently in Sydney I told <a href="http://toolmantim.com/">toolmantim</a> about my failed attempts using Rails and he told me about <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a>, the lightweight Ruby web framework which sounded like what I had originally hoped Rails would be.</p>



<p>Just two weeks ago I started <a href="http://darkroom.heroku.com/">Darkroom</a> in my spare time with no experience writing Ruby. Today it&#8217;s basically complete: a big Flickr slideshow presentation!</p>



<p>See it in action with <a href="http://darkroom.heroku.com/photos/Wolfgang+Bartelme/sets/72157622707212478">this gorgeous set of nature photos</a> by Wolfgang Bartelme or <a href="http://darkroom.heroku.com/photos/Jorge+Quinteros">Jorge Quinteros&#8217;s photostream</a>.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s even a bookmarklet for redirecting Flickr URLs to Darkroom URLs!</p>



<p>The idea was born from my frustration with Flickr&#8217;s 500px wide default with no way to navigate between photos and anything larger outside the Flash slideshow. <a href="http://ihardlyknowher.com/">I Hardly Know Her</a> tackled the same issue but falls short, defaulting to a smaller size and not offering titles or descriptions.</p>



<p>Sinatra has built in support for <a href="http://haml-lang.com/">HAML</a> and <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a> two more tools I&#8217;ve wanted to try for a while. They&#8217;re both a joy. Writing vanilla HTML and CSS feels like running in soft sand. I&#8217;m planning to convert almost every web property I have to Sinatra if only for the effortless HAML and SASS support.</p>



<p>The last piece of the puzzle is deployment with <a href="http://heroku.com/">Heroku</a>, a process which is nothing short of magic. From start to finish the combination of Sinatra, HAML, SASS and Heroku is the kind of elegance and simplicity that I&#8217;d always hoped Ruby on Rails was.</p>

<p>The entire front end has been redesigned, including <a href="http://getcampusnotes.com/jimwhimpey/214-welcome">shared notes</a> and there&#8217;s a few nice new features in the back end like the ability to inline embed attached images.</p>

<p>This saddens me. I love the iPhone and assume I&#8217;ll love the iPad but they are great almost only for consuming. The market of consumers is obviously much larger than that of creators but it&#8217;s a shame development of the consumer&#8217;s device and software has to come at the expense of the creator&#8217;s.</p>

<p>The whole thing feels weird to me. Why would Loren Brichter abandon his massively successful independently run <a href="http://www.atebits.com/">business</a>, the freedom and control that comes with it to be another cog in the Twitter machine? It&#8217;d be a different story if Tweetie was languishing in obscurity but it&#8217;s got to be the most popular Twitter  iPhone <em>and</em> Mac client. I guess they gave him a bag of money too big to refuse.</p>



<p>It&#8217;ll be interesting to see what happens to Tweetie for Mac, my favourite Twitter desktop client.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There is a high end restaurant that sits literally over the river not far from where I live. I have no idea how it got the position, there&#8217;s no other business anywhere near the bank of the river 5km in either direction. They&#8217;re quite famous in Brisbane for their location and apparently the food is pretty good, albeit expensive.</p>



<p>They recently attached a platform jetty off the main restaurant building, filled it with tables and opened it as a fish and chip shop. This pleased me because there&#8217;s no other fish and chip shop within walking distance and I liked the idea walking along the river before eating on the water.</p>



<p>I picked up a menu next time I passed, found that the cheapest item available was $15 and wrote off the idea forever.</p>



<p>It sits right on the bikeway that runs into the city and I pass this place often. From the bikeway you can see the every table on the jetty. In the three months or so it&#8217;s been open I have seen <em>one</em> person eating there.</p>



<p>One month into the opening they must have got sick of putting out and putting away a full set of tables for next to no customers so they started putting out only three tables. This meant only about 25% of the jetty was used and it looked ridiculous. Still no one ate there.</p>



<p>A month later I guess they realised how pathetic it looked to have a jetty with only three unoccupied tables and they switched back to the full compliment of unoccupied tables. Since then I still don&#8217;t see anyone eating there.</p>
