<blockquote>

  <p>Because if you&#8217;re honest, no matter where you stand, no matter your politics, religion, income or mode of transport, you see this beast of creeping death and you understand: That is us. The spill may be many things, <strong>but more than anything else it is a giant, horrifying mirror</strong>.</p>

  

  <p>[&#8230;]</p>

  

  <p>As if oil wasn&#8217;t woven like oxygen into every single aspect of American life, as if fully 30 percent of domestic transportation fuel didn&#8217;t come from the gulf, as if shutting down a fraction of those wells wouldn&#8217;t re-devastate the economy, as if petroleum and coal weren&#8217;t powering the very energy plants that deliver the electricity that charges the iPhones that allows everyone to Tweet their angry complaints through all the various energy-sucking server farms the size of a small country.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>I&#8217;ve made a few life decisions with the goal of reducing my personal fossil fuel dependance: sold my car, stopped eating meat but it&#8217;s not enough. Even buying food from the supermarket who have things delivered by thousands of trucks, ships and air planes is participating in the destructive economy of oil dependance.</p>



<p>This man made disaster has affected me deeply and I have to do more if only personally and for my own conscience. Step one has to be owning my own home.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The mainstream media has recently picked up on what the internet media has been complaining about for years: Facebook has a lot of information about you which it can use almost however it wants. Complaining about this baffles me.</p>



<p>Facebook is not mandatory and nor is it a right. There&#8217;s a simple way to completely eliminate the risk of Facebook exploiting your data: don&#8217;t give it your data. If you like Facebook and find utility in what it offers the risk might be worth the reward.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote>The Subaru system, called Eyesight, uses two stereo cameras mounted at the top of the windscreen to study the road, cars, bicycles and pedestrians to avoid collisions.</blockquote><p>Stephen Ottley reporting for the The Age on <a href="http://theage.drive.com.au/motor-news/the-cyclistfriendly-car-20100518-vboc.html">Subaru&#8217;s new pedestrian and cyclist friendly car</a>.</p>



<p>As a road riding cyclist who&#8217;s been hit by a car, this cyclist &#8220;friendly&#8221; car scares me. It does nothing but remove the onus for concentrating on the road from drivers already not paying enough attention.</p>



<p>The system has some nice practical applications though:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>It can also detect if the car ahead has taken off at the traffic lights and give the driver a reminder audio warning to start driving.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>and:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Eyesight can detect if the driver accidentally selects &#8216;Drive&#8217; instead of reverse and limit the amount of power delivered to the wheels.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Great, a stopgap for stupidity! No longer is stupidity an obstacle when it comes to controlling a high powered, three ton chuck of steel.</p>

  <p>Starting today, I’m joining <a href="http://banksimple.net/">BankSimple</a> as a co-founder, with the role of Chief Product &amp; Technology Officer. In a nutshell, I’m going to make sure we build something that’s simple, beautiful, and works really really well.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>This is really exciting even though it&#8217;s unlikely BankSimple will stretch outside the US.</p>



<p>Industries like banking are ripe for smart people like Alex Payne to come in and do things <em>right</em>. Fundamentally banking is a simple concept and if you have the capital to begin with surely it&#8217;s possible to make a lot of money without the need to gouge your customers or skimp on things like support and a really good website.</p>



<p>Next please: insurance, real estate, air travel, postal service, supermarkets, etc.</p>



<p>Sidenote: Why do all names of things now have to be a single camel cased &#8220;word&#8221;? Why is BankSimple &#8220;BankSimple&#8221; and not the much more aesthetically pleasing and grammatically correct &#8220;Bank Simple&#8221;?</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/596483252">Yesterday&#8217;s post</a> on Flash&#8217;s claims of openness was linked to on <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/05/14/whimpey">Daring Fireball</a> (and later <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/05/14/flash-developer-tools">followed up</a>) and resulted in <em>a lot</em> of emails telling me how wrong I am.</p>



<p>Admittedly, I was wrong and posted an amendment. In Gruber&#8217;s followup he wrote:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>I still say Whimpey’s conclusion stands — it’s not the tools that make Flash a closed platform, it’s that the runtime, Flash Player, is completely controlled and defined by Adobe. Adobe’s argument is that Flash is an open part of the web but that there just happens to exist only one implementation, their own closed-source Flash Player.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Adobe has published the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/swf/">SWF file format specification</a> which theoretically allows anyone to build authoring tools <em>and</em> interpreters for Flash content. In practice the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gnash/">number one open source Flash player</a> (or at least the only one with any presence online) barely supports anything. From the gnash website:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>[&#8230;] and supports most SWF v7 features and some SWF v8 and v9</p>

</blockquote>



<p>SWF is currently at version 10. The page <a href="http://www.flashmagazine.com/news/detail/open_source_and_free_development_tools_for_flash/">proudly listing</a> open source and free development tools has a section on players:</p>



<blockquote>While the specs for creating SWF files are <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/swf/">freely available</a>, it&#8217;s not currently possible to create fully featured Flash Players as Open Source. The main reason is that Adobe&#8217;s implementation of the Flash Player makes use of <a href="http://www.adobe.com/de/products/eula/third_party/flashplayer/">technology licensed from several companies</a>.</blockquote>



<p>So my original point stands:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Adobe: not open, claim to be.</p>

  

  <p>Apple: not open, don’t claim to be, contribute heavily to that which is truly open.</p>

</blockquote>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.adobe.com/choice/">Adobe®: We Love Choice</a></p><p>The $600 Flash authoring tool is the only way to produce Flash applications.</p>



<p>The free Mac OS X Developer tools (that require an $800+ Mac computer) are the only way to produce iPhone and iPad applications.</p>



<p>Both systems are as closed as each other.</p>



<p>Adobe claims Flash is open.</p>



<p>Apple makes no such claims. If you want to make iPhone or iPad apps you use Mac OS and Xcode, take it or leave it.</p>



<p>If you choose to leave it the alternative is HTML. A <em>truly</em> open platform for which authoring is as simple as editing text. There&#8217;s many HTML rendering engine implementations, the best few are totally open source with Apple being the major contributor to the best one, WebKit.</p>



<p>Adobe: not open, claim to be.</p>



<p>Apple: not open, don&#8217;t claim to be, contribute heavily to that which is truly open.</p>



<p><strong>Update</strong></p>



<p>As many Daring Fireball readers have pointed out to me via email, I was wrong about Flash (the authoring tool) being the only way to publish SWF files.</p>



<p>SWF is a standard that Adobe has published information on how to produce. However, Flash (the player) is the only appication that can interpret SWF files and my closing point stands.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I agree with Julio Ody in that <a href="http://julio-ody.tumblr.com/post/552745613/why-tony-stark-is-better-than-you">design competency is hugely advantageous</a> for developers but disagree on the tools he first suggests:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Stop believing Photoshop, Pixelmator, Illustrator, or anything else is too hard.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>They <em>are</em> too hard, too inefficient, too poorly suited to designing web UIs, too expensive and simply unnecessary. It&#8217;s followed by much better advice:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Still don’t want to fork the cash for these suites, or you consider yourself really incapable of learning any of them? Design straight in HTML and CSS.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Anything you can&#8217;t do in HTML and CSS is more design than any developer should be concerning themselves with. Besides, it&#8217;s faster, less fiddly, more precise, easily scriptable, repeatable, you&#8217;ll always have real content to work with and obviously, it&#8217;ll always look exactly like the end result. Starting your design in HTML and CSS (or better, HAML and SASS) is simply better.</p>



<p><a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com">This blog</a>, <a href="http://getcampusnotes.com/">Campus Notes</a>, <a href="http://solidbase.tumblr.com/">A Solid Base</a> and <a href="http://darkroom.heroku.com/">Darkroom</a> were all designed with minimal or (more commonly) no contact at all with a graphics editor. While none of them are visually stunning, that&#8217;s not the goal. The goal is not letting <em>poor</em> design get in the way and not having to rely on a designer to prevent it.</p>



<p>Three years ago I wrote <a href="http://archive.valhallaisland.com/blog/2007/simple-ways-to-help-your-design-suck-less-1/">a post about simple things you can do to help your design suck less</a>. All of my suggestions still stand today and can be implemented more efficiently without thousands of dollars worth of bloated design software.</p>
