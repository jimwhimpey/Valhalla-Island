  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s difficult to tell whether the revolt each time Facebook makes significant changes is because of a resistance to change or having to learn.</p>



<p>Maybe it&#8217;s just a knee-jerk reaction to the sudden realisation of what people consider <em>their own</em> being entirely out of their control. Facebook makes up the massive majority of many people&#8217;s online time — my sister can spend hours on the computer <em>exclusively</em> using Facebook. My non-technical friends who struggle to operate an iPod are <em>experts</em> with the Facebook UI. When you invest that kind of time in something, realising it&#8217;s not yours, that Facebook can do whatever the fuck they want, must be a shock.</p>



<p>People went ape shit when the last changes launched, now those same people are going ape shit about <em>keeping</em> the last changes. Groups will be created, notes written, statuses updated all <em>using the new Facebook</em> to complain about how the new Facebook is so difficult to use. Within a week they&#8217;ll forget Facebook ever looked or behaved differently.</p>

<p>Admittedly I went into Watchmen with high expectations. The <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/wb/watchmen/">trailers</a> were gorgeous, the hype was high, I&#8217;ve loved each movie based on a graphic novel I&#8217;ve seen and I <em>especially</em> loved 300. It would have been difficult for Watchmen to be anything but a disappointment.</p>



<p>The music, montages, scenes and costumes were all beautiful. The story was long and complicated. So complicated that I still don&#8217;t understand basics like how Rorschach or Laurie Juspeczyk became part of the Watchmen (or is it the Minutemen?) while some left (Hooded Justice) and others stayed (The Comedian).</p>



<p>Rorschach was a great character, especially in the jail scenes. Dr Manhattan was refreshingly different to God-like characters in other stories. Nite Owl was a pathetic loser who I didn&#8217;t care for at all.</p>



<p>In the end it felt like the best was made of what (I imagine) is a pretty complex story not suited to cinema.</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>But I’m not the target buyer for this device. If you walk along any city street, ride a subway or bus, or wander through the local gym, you’ll see that nearly everyone uses the stock Apple earbuds. It’s not that their ears are any more ideal for these things than mine, it’s just that most people don’t care or know any better. <em>This is what I got, this is what I’ll use.</em></p>

</blockquote>



<p>I don&#8217;t see the current requirement for the bundled Apple headphones as an issue. Even I use the white earphones with my iPod Shuffle, a guy who uses $300 Sennheisers played through a headphone amplifier at home. Carrying anything bigger or more expensive than the stock headphones with a Shuffle defeats the purpose of the inexpensive and small Shuffle.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re willing to carry around a giant pair of headphones and spend $300+ on them, you&#8217;re willing to carry around a bigger, more expensive iPod, the Shuffle is not for you.</p>

<p>They&#8217;re obviously <em>different</em> but what are the advantages and disadvantage of each? That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been researching today, here&#8217;s a summary of what I found.</p>



<p>TT bikes are designed to be the most <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerodynamics">aerodynamic</a> possible. Not just in the bike&#8217;s frame and components but the position they force you to ride in. They have a more upright seat tube, shorter wheel base, shorter top tube and low aerobars which together force riders to crouch low, minimising drag and hopefully going faster.</p>



<p>But wouldn&#8217;t road bikes also benefit from these drag reducing features? Yes but the trade off in a TT or triathlon bike is less manoeuvrability and a less comfortable ride. Depending on your body and what you&#8217;re used to the ride could be so uncomfortable that it affects your riding style and speed negating any advantage gained by reducing drag.</p>



<p>Less manoeuvrability means more difficultly navigating tight courses and much more difficulty climbing. Less comfort means fatigue over long distances.</p>



<p>So basically, road bikes are for long distances and hills, TT bikes are for short, generally straight and flat courses where every second counts.</p>



<p>Then why are TT-style triathlon bikes rode in races like the Ironman, with a 180km bike course that&#8217;s just as long as any given stage in the Tour de France? For one, personal aerodynamics are much more important in a triathlon that doesn&#8217;t allow <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_bicycle_racing#Tactics">drafting</a> (the drag reducing advantage of drafting in a tour is much greater than a flatter riding style or aerodynamic bike frame can provide). Ironman bike courses also tend to loop and contain limited hills. If rode regularly and fitted properly a TT bike is far less uncomfortable.</p>



<p>As a beginner triathlete I think it&#8217;s still difficult to say which way to go.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>The majority of Australian banks recently <a href="http://news.theage.com.au/breaking-news-business/nab-defends-atm-fee-under-new-charges-20090303-8n9j.html">increased the fee</a> for using another institution&#8217;s ATM to $2. There&#8217;s been a backlash with special segments on the news, radio talk shows and letters to the editor — all people complaining about the exorbitant fees. One letter reads:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>I hold my account with a credit union, as I like to support community organisations and enjoy the personal service received from the branch. Unfortunately, there is a limited network of ATMs available to credit union customers. Therefore, to me this fee is crippling, as I use other banks&#8217; ATMs regularly.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>To get it straight, this woman wants the personal service of a credit union, with the convenience of ubiquitous ATMs and doesn&#8217;t want to pay for it. You can&#8217;t have it all, in everything there are tradeoffs. You want to support the community and receive personal service, you have to pay more (or go further, or get more cash out) each time you use an ATM. You want free (or cheap) ATM withdrawals anywhere you are, forfeit the personal service, support the community in other ways.</p>



<p>The tradeoff doesn&#8217;t even have to be that dramatic, how about some simple changes in behaviour to account for the change in fees? Start carrying more cash, get in the habit of withdrawing money from your bank&#8217;s ATMs when you <em>do</em> see them whether you need cash or not.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m sick of the <em>this sucks</em> because <em>this is the way I do things and I don&#8217;t want to change</em> attitude: Higher ATM usage fees suck <em>because I use ATMs regularly</em>! A $2 fee is considered outrageous while making the slightest change to the way you do things is considered completely and utterly out of the question. Complaining is the <em>only</em> option.</p>



<p>The case is the same for motorists who complain about fuel prices, road tolls, insurance costs and slow traffic. Driving <em>sucks</em> but using public transport, biking, walking or moving closer to your destination aren&#8217;t alternatives worth wasting your time considering.</p>
