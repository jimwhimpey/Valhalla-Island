  <div class="entry-content"><p>Four and a half years ago John Gruber <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2005/06/shuffling">wrote</a>:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Remember: every decision you force a customer to make is another chance for them to decide to just walk away.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>That resonated with me then was clearly demonstrated to me this week.</p>



<p>Two days ago I was <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/217965736">obviously excited</a> about  the new internationally available Amazon Kindle. I&#8217;d wanted one for a long time but it&#8217;s only now a possibility. Buying one was only a matter of having enough spare cash.</p>



<p>Enter the <a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/nook/index.asp">Nook</a>.</p>



<p>Is it better than the Kindle? It&#8217;s not as well established, the Kindle&#8217;s already had many great reviews but maybe the Nook has learnt from the few issues people have with the Kindle? It has a touch screen colour LCD and virtual keyboard, is that better than the Kindle&#8217;s equivalent? Is wifi important? Does Barnes &amp; Noble have the same range of books at similar prices? Are they better prices? How does battery life compare? Is it insignificant when both devices have such long battery life? Is the ability to share important to me? If it&#8217;s important is it even practical?</p>



<p>What two days ago was a sure thing is now a mountain of questions and I&#8217;m weighed down by the burden to decide.</p>



<p>So I consolidate the questions down to one: do I need an eBook reader at all?</p>



<p>No.</p>



<p>Burden relieved.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><img src="/assets/tumblr/tumblr_krwpho3ESX1qzwfbio1_500.jpg"/><br/><p>I enjoy most sports and half follow many but there&#8217;s one league and team I&#8217;m dedicated to, the AFL and the Brisbane Lions. While they&#8217;ve always had a relatively nice <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Brisbane_Lions_Jumper.svg">strip</a> their logo can only be described as dated and one of the ugliest logos <em>of all time</em>. As of just a few hours ago that&#8217;s been totally turned around with this gorgeous new look. The colours, type, illustration and composition are all perfect, they couldn&#8217;t have done a better job.</p>



<p>It also looks great in single colour and <a href="http://static.jimwhimpey.com/images/lions-variations.jpg">a number of variations</a> making it super flexible â€” the opposite of the old, complicated, multi-gradient atrocity.</p>

<p>The 30&#8221; Cinema Display costs A$2,798.</p>



<p>The new 27&#8221; iMac costs A$2,199.</p>



<p>For $700 more than the LED Cinema Display you can get the 27&#8221; iMac, a powerful computer (more powerful than even the most powerful Mac Mini that costs A$1,399), a larger by 3&#8221; display with greater pixel density <em>and</em> a wireless keyboard and mouse.</p>



<p>For $600 more than the 27&#8221; iMac you can get a 30&#8221; Cinema Display with lower pixel density, inferior CCFL-backlit specifications and you don&#8217;t get the <em>computer</em>, keyboard or mouse.</p>



<p>With every new release and update to Apple&#8217;s line of computers their line of displays gets further out of sync. The 27&#8221; iMac is now the most attractive and almost the best value <em>display</em> option in Apple&#8217;s line up.</p>

I love to read but paying $20 for shipping and having to wait 3 weeks for a book to arrive from Amazon is crazy. Books are unwieldy and the iPhone makes a decent intermediate device but is far from ideal for reading in long stretches. I&#8217;ve really come to enjoy reading anything via <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> which bodes well for a device dedicated to reading.</p>



<p>I know the basics but I&#8217;d held off reading too much about it because I knew it wasn&#8217;t a possibility. Time to dive into some reviews, starting with <a href="http://a.wholelottanothing.org/2009/03/its-a-kindle-world-now.html">this one from Matt Haughey</a>.</p>

<p>As much as <a href="http://last.fm/user/fightingfriends">I really enjoy music</a> and curate a decent-sized library, I&#8217;m bad at staying up to date with new releases from my favourite bands. Sometimes six months will pass before I&#8217;m even aware of a new album from someone I apparently love. So every time I use a tool like <a href="http://albumspotter.com/">Album Spotter</a> to find out what I&#8217;m missing, I get flooded with new, great music and it&#8217;s a joy. This is one of those songs.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My workplace has a liberal dress policy, you can just as easily get away with a nice shirt, pant and tie as you can shorts and a hoodie. What I&#8217;ve worn every day since starting there lands right between the two. A pair of slacks with a button down collared shirt which is sometimes tucked in, sometimes not depending on the combo and a hard-soled shoe.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t mind this outfit, it&#8217;s basically comfortable and practical. But I don&#8217;t <em>love</em> it, outside of work I&#8217;m reluctant to wear long pants at all and I hate jeans. I ride to work so the hard shoe isn&#8217;t ideal, I need to roll up my pant cuffs and as we get towards the end of the year it&#8217;s only getting hotter.</p>



<p>Theoretically I prefer my current dress, if not something nicer, I like the idea of looking sharp. Practically, I&#8217;d be much more comfortable in shorts during the day and my commute would be more enjoyable but I&#8217;d look less professional. I&#8217;m leaning towards shorts.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Car commercials dominate almost the only kind of television I watch, sport. With no exceptions, every car advertised mentions its impressively powerful engine, many running entire campaigns around performance.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t understand it. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_(automobile)">Smart Car</a> with its 3 cylinder, 1 litre engine has a top speed of 130&#160;km/h, 20km/h <em>beyond</em> the highest legal speed limit of any road in Australia. How is any power beyond that, <em>always</em> at the expense of fuel economy, practical let alone a selling point?</p>



<p>Why are 6 cylinder cars even something you can buy? Is there anything else for sale in the world so needlessly excessive? Every equivalent I can imagine is totally insane. Like a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/traveller2020/3935737528/">60 metre wide screen</a> for your lounge room.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I really like the concept of creating rules to govern your life. It makes things simpler and decisions easier but 20 rules is <em>way</em> too many for <em>anything</em>. Here&#8217;s the three I&#8217;d limit it to:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Don&#8217;t eat anything that took more energy to ship than to grow.</p>

  

  <p>If you are not hungry enough to eat an apple, then you are not hungry.</p>

  

  <p>Don&#8217;t eat anything you aren&#8217;t willing to kill yourself.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>The graphic in my <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/204911046">last post</a> was composed using <a href="http://www.flyingmeat.com/acorn/">Acorn</a>. I always download these alternative graphics applications, spend about five seconds drawing a line or a box, quit and never open them again, hardly a thorough trial. As simple as the result, this was first time practically trialling any of them.</p>



<p>My biggest issue with Fireworks and Illustrator is bloat. I use a tiny subset of Fireworks&#8217; features. Which would be fine if everything I don&#8217;t use wasn&#8217;t in the way, cluttering the UI, making the entire application slow and prone to crashing while bugs remain in the subset I <em>do</em> use.</p>



<p>Acorn solves that issue, it launches in a second with a well-thought out, organised UI offering only the features you need.</p>



<p>Yet, like other hopeful Creative Suite challengers, it persists with the confusing, unintuitive and plain frustrating layers metaphor. Far and away the best thing about Fireworks and Illustrator is that they treat elements as <em>individual objects</em>, use layers if you want but they&#8217;re purely an organisational tool.</p>



<p>Photoshop has by far the most frustrating implementation of layers, you can&#8217;t even select a box without consulting the layers palette. Acorn isn&#8217;t that bad but in my small trial I was frustrated twice. First by the inability to shift select elements between layers and then by having the opacity meter affect every object on the layer of my selected object rather than simply my selected object.</p>



<p>I want to draw elements, resize them, align them and set type â€” I don&#8217;t want to administrate layers. While apps like Acorn hold on to the archaic and unintuitive layers paradigm they&#8217;ll never be a viable option for me.</p>

<ol><li>I think they look fantastic.</li>

<li>I really want them.</li>

<li>I plan to order a pack as soon as I get home.</li>

<li>I remind myself that I very rarely use paper at all and have no desire to start so a $10 pack of designer notebooks is of no use to me, no matter how good they look.</li>

<li>I forget about Field Notes.</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A service that allows products to be bought from US online stores, shipped to a US address before being forwarded on to an international address. Charge face value for shipping and a low percentage of the item&#8217;s value or a flat fee (say 3% or $20) for each shipment.</p>



<p>The Apple Store is a great example of where I&#8217;d use this service all the time.</p>



<p>Cost of the baseline Mac Pro from the Australian Apple Store: <strong>AU$4500</strong></p>



<p>Cost of the baseline Mac Pro from the US Apple Store after exchange rate conversion: <strong>AU$2860</strong></p>



<p>Over AU$1600 cheaper for an identical computer that simply originates at a different location, even if shipping was another $100 and the US-based package forwarder charged $100 for their simple service, it&#8217;s still much cheaper than buying it from the Australian store.</p>



<p>The biggest issue would be trust. What&#8217;s stopping them from keeping whatever you need forwarded? Apart from the &#8220;never deal with <em>x</em> again&#8221; blog post that could mean they never receive anything again. By then they might have a nice new computer delivered to their door so who cares?</p>



<p>If a service could build up a solid reputation of trustworthiness starting with inconsequential, cheaper items, it might work.</p>
