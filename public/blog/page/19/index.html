  <div class="entry-content"><img src="/assets/tumblr/tumblr_kr18hqSDxM1qzwfbio1_500.png"/><br/><p>Brisbane is a city that likes its bridges. A brand new pedestrian and cycling bridge opened over the weekend and another motorist bridge is well under construction. Seven of the bridges are within a 1500m river shoreline, then there&#8217;s nothing for five or six kilometres until the university. Even one bridge splitting that gap, connecting Toowong to West End, would be nice.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A service that allows products to be bought from US online stores, shipped to a US address before being forwarded on to an international address. Charge face value for shipping and a low percentage of the item&#8217;s value or a flat fee (say 3% or $20) for each shipment.</p>



<p>The Apple Store is a great example of where I&#8217;d use this service all the time.</p>



<p>Cost of the baseline Mac Pro from the Australian Apple Store: <strong>AU$4500</strong></p>



<p>Cost of the baseline Mac Pro from the US Apple Store after exchange rate conversion: <strong>AU$2860</strong></p>



<p>Over AU$1600 cheaper for an identical computer that simply originates at a different location, even if shipping was another $100 and the US-based package forwarder charged $100 for their simple service, it&#8217;s still much cheaper than buying it from the Australian store.</p>



<p>The biggest issue would be trust. What&#8217;s stopping them from keeping whatever you need forwarded? Apart from the &#8220;never deal with <em>x</em> again&#8221; blog post that could mean they never receive anything again. By then they might have a nice new computer delivered to their door so who cares?</p>



<p>If a service could build up a solid reputation of trustworthiness starting with inconsequential, cheaper items, it might work.</p>

	        <h2 class="entry-title">Buying a Couch</h2>
	      
			
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m more than happy with the build and simplicity of Ikea furniture for almost anything but when it comes to a couch, I want something big, robust and super comfortable. Since moving we&#8217;ve now got everything we <em>need</em> and it&#8217;s time to start replacing our crappiest things that have simply done the job with some better things. I&#8217;ve always wanted a corner lounge and our current couches are old hand-me-downs.</p>



<p>We quickly found a great corner lounge for $2300, much too expensive.</p>



<p>A couple of weeks later we resumed the search and found the exact same couch on sale for $1600! A massive $700 off and well within our price range, great! We measured our lounge room and went to the furniture store, measuring tape in hand, ready to lay down the cash.</p>



<p>We found the couch, sat in the couch, loved the couch and then measured the couch. Too big, no way it&#8217;d fit. We browsed the other 80+ couches in the store, none came anywhere near the comfort, practicality (it has a built-in bed) or price of the original brilliant lounge.</p>



<p>We came home and slumped into our ridiculously low, vinyl, old, two seater lounges, dejected.</p>



<p>Then I had a brilliant idea, a complete rearrangement of the lounge room into a layout so crazy it just might work. The more we thought about, the more we measured and mapped out, the more possible and just plain superior to our current setup it looked! Great! We can buy the couch, first thing next weekend!</p>



<p>This afternoon I check the website looking for a phone number so I could ask about getting it up our stairs and into the apartment. <strong>Horror</strong>! The couch is no longer on sale for $1600 but for $2000! Fuck!</p>



<p>I call the store, begging for the sale price of just two days ago, when we were ready to buy. He told me the probably-bullshit story of their suppliers upping the price but agreed to meet me half way, $1800. I reluctantly accepted.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Tumblarity is a curse. My tumblarity graphed would look something like a sine wave. I start low, feel no pressure, post what&#8217;s on my mind when it&#8217;s on my mind and find myself on a roll. My tumblarity rises. I feel a burden to keep it high, get anxious about finding or creating content to post, when I do have something I rush it together then worry about the right time of day to post or whether it&#8217;s good enough to post at all.  The result is contrived posts and less of them. My tumblarity gradually (it actually happens pretty quickly) drops to rock bottom, I feel free again, the writing and creativity flows. Repeat.</p>



<p>This whole process may have always happened naturally with slow weeks, good days and the like. Whatever algorithm powers tumblarity just does a great job of noticing.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.cabel.name/2009/09/windows-7-party.html">Cabel</a> says it well:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Can I just stop here, and can we be honest with each other? Does this kind of acting resonate with anybody? [&#8230;] Are there people who can relate to — let alone enjoy — this video? And has there ever been a more vibrant and tangible demonstration of the difference between Apple and Microsoft?</p>

</blockquote>



<p>At first I thought I&#8217;d need to be careful to avoid overstating my case as what&#8217;s wrong with this video (and on a higher level, the entire concept) should be crystal clear to <em>everyone</em>. But obviously it&#8217;s not, this and the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/LaunchParties#play/uploads">other 100+ supporting videos</a> didn&#8217;t make themselves. <em>Real people</em> had to pitch, write, storyboard, film, direct, edit, publish and <em>sign off on</em> this series. Having read many <a href="http://moishelettvin.blogspot.com/2006/11/windows-shutdown-crapfest.html">stories about the bureaucracy</a> involved in writing software for Microsoft surely that same bureaucracy should stop videos like this ever reaching the public eye.</p>



<p>The concept is insane. I <em>love</em> OS X and there is <em>no way</em> I would ever host a &#8220;launch party&#8221; for a new release, no matter what the incentive. Who the fuck are they targetting with this campaign? Who in their right mind invites friends into their homes to promote a product they have absolutely no stake in? The people in these commercials don&#8217;t exist, the way they&#8217;re acting and talking is down right <em>creepy</em>.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s another strange, completely unrealistic <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=GB&amp;hl=en-GB&amp;v=3oGFogwcx-E">marketing video for Microsoft Songsmith</a>.</p>



<p>What is <em>wrong</em> with Microsoft? As much as you might like Windows, is software made by the same people who invest resources into embarrassingly out-of-touch marketing campaigns like these something anyone can get behind? Like finding out your favourite football player is into dog fighting, they&#8217;re unrelated but you can&#8217;t ignore it.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>For a long time I&#8217;ve been totally satisfied with the 24&#8221; iMac. It&#8217;s powerful (enough), the screen is big and it&#8217;s great value. Since picking up my new Macbook Pro, with it&#8217;s faster processor, LED screen and ability to power a 30&#8221; second screen my iMac feels very limited.</p>



<p>Then I <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/190104473">got frustrated</a> with my 20&#8221; second screen and started thinking about a single bigger display altogether. Just as I run out of hard drive space. The iMac can only power a second screen with resolution up to 1920 x 1280 (24&#8221; usually) but I want to ditch the dual setup, go single and bigger. The iMac can&#8217;t take additional external drives and even replacing the internal drive is a difficult task. I can always buy more external drives but they&#8217;re more expensive, can be unreliable when running through multiple USB hubs and the speed has nothing on internal drives.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m ready to upgrade from the iMac. So what&#8217;s the next step? The Mac Pro. A computer that starts at ridiculously powerful and the-cost-of-a-small-island expensive and only goes up from there.</p>



<p>My iMac is $2500, the baseline Mac Pro is $4500, add a 24&#8221; screen and you&#8217;re looking at $6000. A $3500 jump for the next logical step in the Mac desktop lineup. $3500 for the ability to customise with multiple hard drives and video cards. The gap between the iMac and the Mac Pro is huge. A Core 2 Duo powered Mac Pro would do the job but I doubt Apple want their Mac Pros to be seen as anything but beastly powerful machines.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote>For diamonds do appear to be, just like broken glass to me.</blockquote>Quoting Panic at the Disco lyrics makes me feel 14 years old but this line resonates strongly with me. I don&#8217;t understand jewellery at all. I can&#8217;t think of a greater waste of money. Even watches, the only piece of jewellery with any practical utility whatsoever are too decorative and expensive to be worth it.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A week ago I cleaned my wireless Apple keyboard as I had many times before. This time it left my p,&#160;; and / keys nonfunctional, rendering the whole keyboard useless. This comes at a time I was thinking about replacing my regular Apple keyboard at work with the wireless equivalent.</p>



<p>The decision to get the wireless keyboard in the first place was hard enough — $109 to replace something perfectly functioning, only wireless is ridiculously decadent. Yet having to use the wired version is driving me insane. I realise these are irrational feelings, there&#8217;s no practical reason I need a wireless keyboard at all let alone in exchange for $109.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jimwhimpey/2966100477/">My Day, Yesterday, One Year Ago</a></p><p>I was reminded lately about Garrett Murray&#8217;s <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/mydayyesterday/pool/">My Day, Yesterday Flickr pool</a> I participated in. It was a fun exercise at the time (I find video and audio editing oddly soothing) but it&#8217;s especially interesting looking back. Just one year later my days are vastly different, I can&#8217;t believe I drove from home to one campus and back before getting the train to another and getting home after dark. More than 3 hours of travel for just 3 hours of class!</p>



<p>I&#8217;m someone who finds it difficult to interrupt what I&#8217;m doing to take photos or record video in day to day life so I have little record (beyond memories) of what life was like at any one time. Dedicating a day every year or so to something like this could really be valuable to someone like me.</p>
