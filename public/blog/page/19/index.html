It&#8217;s done the same way for every other user submission on FTiM which up until now I&#8217;d assumed were all coming from the blog&#8217;s author because of the lack of sourcing in the post body.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My workplace has a liberal dress policy, you can just as easily get away with a nice shirt, pant and tie as you can shorts and a hoodie. What I&#8217;ve worn every day since starting there lands right between the two. A pair of slacks with a button down collared shirt which is sometimes tucked in, sometimes not depending on the combo and a hard-soled shoe.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t mind this outfit, it&#8217;s basically comfortable and practical. But I don&#8217;t <em>love</em> it, outside of work I&#8217;m reluctant to wear long pants at all and I hate jeans. I ride to work so the hard shoe isn&#8217;t ideal, I need to roll up my pant cuffs and as we get towards the end of the year it&#8217;s only getting hotter.</p>



<p>Theoretically I prefer my current dress, if not something nicer, I like the idea of looking sharp. Practically, I&#8217;d be much more comfortable in shorts during the day and my commute would be more enjoyable but I&#8217;d look less professional. I&#8217;m leaning towards shorts.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Car commercials dominate almost the only kind of television I watch, sport. With no exceptions, every car advertised mentions its impressively powerful engine, many running entire campaigns around performance.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t understand it. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_(automobile)">Smart Car</a> with its 3 cylinder, 1 litre engine has a top speed of 130&#160;km/h, 20km/h <em>beyond</em> the highest legal speed limit of any road in Australia. How is any power beyond that, <em>always</em> at the expense of fuel economy, practical let alone a selling point?</p>



<p>Why are 6 cylinder cars even something you can buy? Is there anything else for sale in the world so needlessly excessive? Every equivalent I can imagine is totally insane. Like a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/traveller2020/3935737528/">60 metre wide screen</a> for your lounge room.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I really like the concept of creating rules to govern your life. It makes things simpler and decisions easier but 20 rules is <em>way</em> too many for <em>anything</em>. Here&#8217;s the three I&#8217;d limit it to:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Don&#8217;t eat anything that took more energy to ship than to grow.</p>

  

  <p>If you are not hungry enough to eat an apple, then you are not hungry.</p>

  

  <p>Don&#8217;t eat anything you aren&#8217;t willing to kill yourself.</p>

	        <h2 class="entry-title">Layers</h2>
	      
			
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>The graphic in my <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/204911046">last post</a> was composed using <a href="http://www.flyingmeat.com/acorn/">Acorn</a>. I always download these alternative graphics applications, spend about five seconds drawing a line or a box, quit and never open them again, hardly a thorough trial. As simple as the result, this was first time practically trialling any of them.</p>



<p>My biggest issue with Fireworks and Illustrator is bloat. I use a tiny subset of Fireworks&#8217; features. Which would be fine if everything I don&#8217;t use wasn&#8217;t in the way, cluttering the UI, making the entire application slow and prone to crashing while bugs remain in the subset I <em>do</em> use.</p>



<p>Acorn solves that issue, it launches in a second with a well-thought out, organised UI offering only the features you need.</p>



<p>Yet, like other hopeful Creative Suite challengers, it persists with the confusing, unintuitive and plain frustrating layers metaphor. Far and away the best thing about Fireworks and Illustrator is that they treat elements as <em>individual objects</em>, use layers if you want but they&#8217;re purely an organisational tool.</p>



<p>Photoshop has by far the most frustrating implementation of layers, you can&#8217;t even select a box without consulting the layers palette. Acorn isn&#8217;t that bad but in my small trial I was frustrated twice. First by the inability to shift select elements between layers and then by having the opacity meter affect every object on the layer of my selected object rather than simply my selected object.</p>



<p>I want to draw elements, resize them, align them and set type — I don&#8217;t want to administrate layers. While apps like Acorn hold on to the archaic and unintuitive layers paradigm they&#8217;ll never be a viable option for me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A service that allows products to be bought from US online stores, shipped to a US address before being forwarded on to an international address. Charge face value for shipping and a low percentage of the item&#8217;s value or a flat fee (say 3% or $20) for each shipment.</p>



<p>The Apple Store is a great example of where I&#8217;d use this service all the time.</p>



<p>Cost of the baseline Mac Pro from the Australian Apple Store: <strong>AU$4500</strong></p>



<p>Cost of the baseline Mac Pro from the US Apple Store after exchange rate conversion: <strong>AU$2860</strong></p>



<p>Over AU$1600 cheaper for an identical computer that simply originates at a different location, even if shipping was another $100 and the US-based package forwarder charged $100 for their simple service, it&#8217;s still much cheaper than buying it from the Australian store.</p>



<p>The biggest issue would be trust. What&#8217;s stopping them from keeping whatever you need forwarded? Apart from the &#8220;never deal with <em>x</em> again&#8221; blog post that could mean they never receive anything again. By then they might have a nice new computer delivered to their door so who cares?</p>



<p>If a service could build up a solid reputation of trustworthiness starting with inconsequential, cheaper items, it might work.</p>

	        <h2 class="entry-title">Buying a Couch</h2>
	      
			
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m more than happy with the build and simplicity of Ikea furniture for almost anything but when it comes to a couch, I want something big, robust and super comfortable. Since moving we&#8217;ve now got everything we <em>need</em> and it&#8217;s time to start replacing our crappiest things that have simply done the job with some better things. I&#8217;ve always wanted a corner lounge and our current couches are old hand-me-downs.</p>



<p>We quickly found a great corner lounge for $2300, much too expensive.</p>



<p>A couple of weeks later we resumed the search and found the exact same couch on sale for $1600! A massive $700 off and well within our price range, great! We measured our lounge room and went to the furniture store, measuring tape in hand, ready to lay down the cash.</p>



<p>We found the couch, sat in the couch, loved the couch and then measured the couch. Too big, no way it&#8217;d fit. We browsed the other 80+ couches in the store, none came anywhere near the comfort, practicality (it has a built-in bed) or price of the original brilliant lounge.</p>



<p>We came home and slumped into our ridiculously low, vinyl, old, two seater lounges, dejected.</p>



<p>Then I had a brilliant idea, a complete rearrangement of the lounge room into a layout so crazy it just might work. The more we thought about, the more we measured and mapped out, the more possible and just plain superior to our current setup it looked! Great! We can buy the couch, first thing next weekend!</p>



<p>This afternoon I check the website looking for a phone number so I could ask about getting it up our stairs and into the apartment. <strong>Horror</strong>! The couch is no longer on sale for $1600 but for $2000! Fuck!</p>



<p>I call the store, begging for the sale price of just two days ago, when we were ready to buy. He told me the probably-bullshit story of their suppliers upping the price but agreed to meet me half way, $1800. I reluctantly accepted.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Tumblarity is a curse. My tumblarity graphed would look something like a sine wave. I start low, feel no pressure, post what&#8217;s on my mind when it&#8217;s on my mind and find myself on a roll. My tumblarity rises. I feel a burden to keep it high, get anxious about finding or creating content to post, when I do have something I rush it together then worry about the right time of day to post or whether it&#8217;s good enough to post at all.  The result is contrived posts and less of them. My tumblarity gradually (it actually happens pretty quickly) drops to rock bottom, I feel free again, the writing and creativity flows. Repeat.</p>



<p>This whole process may have always happened naturally with slow weeks, good days and the like. Whatever algorithm powers tumblarity just does a great job of noticing.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.cabel.name/2009/09/windows-7-party.html">Cabel</a> says it well:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Can I just stop here, and can we be honest with each other? Does this kind of acting resonate with anybody? [&#8230;] Are there people who can relate to — let alone enjoy — this video? And has there ever been a more vibrant and tangible demonstration of the difference between Apple and Microsoft?</p>

</blockquote>



<p>At first I thought I&#8217;d need to be careful to avoid overstating my case as what&#8217;s wrong with this video (and on a higher level, the entire concept) should be crystal clear to <em>everyone</em>. But obviously it&#8217;s not, this and the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/LaunchParties#play/uploads">other 100+ supporting videos</a> didn&#8217;t make themselves. <em>Real people</em> had to pitch, write, storyboard, film, direct, edit, publish and <em>sign off on</em> this series. Having read many <a href="http://moishelettvin.blogspot.com/2006/11/windows-shutdown-crapfest.html">stories about the bureaucracy</a> involved in writing software for Microsoft surely that same bureaucracy should stop videos like this ever reaching the public eye.</p>



<p>The concept is insane. I <em>love</em> OS X and there is <em>no way</em> I would ever host a &#8220;launch party&#8221; for a new release, no matter what the incentive. Who the fuck are they targetting with this campaign? Who in their right mind invites friends into their homes to promote a product they have absolutely no stake in? The people in these commercials don&#8217;t exist, the way they&#8217;re acting and talking is down right <em>creepy</em>.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s another strange, completely unrealistic <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=GB&amp;hl=en-GB&amp;v=3oGFogwcx-E">marketing video for Microsoft Songsmith</a>.</p>



<p>What is <em>wrong</em> with Microsoft? As much as you might like Windows, is software made by the same people who invest resources into embarrassingly out-of-touch marketing campaigns like these something anyone can get behind? Like finding out your favourite football player is into dog fighting, they&#8217;re unrelated but you can&#8217;t ignore it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote>But because we grew up surrounded by big dramatic story arcs in books and movies, we think our lives are supposed to be filled with huge ups and downs! So people pretend there is drama where there is none.</blockquote>I deal with evidence supporting <a href="http://sivers.org/drama">this</a> every day.

  <div class="entry-content"><img src="/assets/tumblr/tumblr_kqex5rH2HQ1qzwfbio1_500.jpg"/><br/><p>That&#8217;s a side by side comparison of the 2009 Ford Focus and the 2008 Ford Focus. I can barely tell the difference. So why do car manufacturers go to <a href="http://www.motorauthority.com/blog/1024799_opel-reveals-car-camouflage-secrets">such great lengths</a> to disguise next year&#8217;s prototypes? Most new models are almost identical to the last. For a business completely bereft of innovation the car industry acts like its reinventing the wheel every year.</p>
