  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote>One thing that was very clear after all these conversations about phones is that there is no “one size fits all” in this market. On Oct. 6th, you’ll see new Windows phones designed for a variety of tastes, needs and price points - with or without keyboards, with or without touch screens, as well as your choice of GPS, accelerometer and high resolution camera.</blockquote><p>This is what&#8217;s <a href="http://windowsteamblog.com/blogs/windowsphone/archive/2009/09/01/windows-phones-are-coming-on-october-6th.aspx">wrong</a> with Microsoft, why is there a choice of GPS, accelerometer and high resolution camera? Why would any one person not want one of those? There&#8217;s no downside. Are customers telling them &#8220;I would love GPS and an accelerometer but give me a <em>low resolution camera</em>, not that high resolution crap!&#8221;?</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Almost once a day <a href="http://minimalmac.com/">Minimal Mac</a> features a post about how to cut stuff out of your menu bar. The most common removal is the time and date, then replaced by <a href="http://www.machinecodex.com/dateline/index.php">DateLine</a>, a timeline style calendar that sits permanently on and spans the entire desktop. How that scores more minimalism points than the current date a click away in the menu bar, iCal or the dashboard, I don&#8217;t know.</p>



<p>Beside that, applications running in the menu bar has got to be the most unobtrusive, &#8216;minimalist&#8217; option. I&#8217;ve seen unwieldy menu bars but the problem isn&#8217;t the menu bar, it&#8217;s running unused applications. Hiding the dock? Easy. Getting every icon off your desktop? Easy. Minimal Mac&#8217;s assault on the menu bar is minimalism for the sake of minimalism at the expense of utility and convenience.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Commercial television in Australia is saturated with ads for two products: cars and universities. <a href="http://www.griffith.edu.au/">Griffith University</a> releases a new advertising campaign every six months and runs it into the ground. <a href="http://www.uq.edu.au/">UQ</a>, <a href="http://www.qut.edu.au/">QUT</a> and <a href="http://www.bond.edu.au/index.htm">Bond</a> do the same. They don&#8217;t limit themselves to TV commercials, the campaign is spread across billboards, buses and stadium advertising. It must cost a lot of money.</p>



<p><a href="http://www.lambdassociates.org/blog/decline.htm">Dr Mark Tarver</a> has seen it first hand as a student and then a professor in Britain and I&#8217;ve experienced it as a student in Australia. Universities are far less about education than they are about making money. They&#8217;re not schools, they&#8217;re businesses selling an &#8216;education&#8217; product but they&#8217;re even doing a bad job of <em>that</em>.</p>



<p>Like so many other businesses: PC makers and phone manufacturers, every car manufacturer, they have it backwards. Start with a shitty, out-dated campus, facilities and program, then reverse your unappealing experience and poor reputation by spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on saturation advertising.</p>



<p>Mount Royal College, the university I attended in Calgary was an incredible place. It was a beautiful, modern campus and residence that featured manicured sports fields, tennis courts, volley ball courts and a huge, olympic-class gym unlike any I have ever seen before or since. The gym included three indoor basketball courts, an indoor running track, an indoor 25 metre pool, hot tub, steam room, 8 squash courts, a climbing wall and a floor full of new, well maintained weight and cardio equipment. The cost to use these facilities for students: $0. It&#8217;s impossible to find equivalent facilities, university or otherwise, in my city no matter how much money you&#8217;re willing to spend. Facilities half as good cost $800/year.</p>



<p>Compare that with the gym facilities at Griffith University&#8217;s largest campus. A 40m2 room with very little, out-dated equipment. The cost to students already paying $3000+ each semester: $100. The difference in gym facilities is a perfect subset of the greater differences betweens schools here and overseas, particularly in North America.</p>



<p>Before you even think about education, Mount Royal is a place you want to be a part of. They start with great facilities and let natural appeal and reputation take care of the marketing. Rather than blow every last dollar on advertising, money is spent on what must be the far more satisfying task of creating a great place to work and study. Both lure students, one has the bonus of happy, involved student body. It&#8217;s no coincidence that the teaching and instruction I received at Mount Royal was also superior and my fellow students were more interested and studious.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m sure schools like Harvard and Yale in the USA don&#8217;t spend a dime on advertising. They&#8217;ve built a reputation for quality in all areas. They didn&#8217;t win that reputation through relentless advertising campaigns.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I order a lot of things online. Even a bad online ordering experience usually beats out the actually going to a store equivalent. I feel like I&#8217;ve run the entire gamut of ordering systems and there&#8217;s a sweet spot. Apple&#8217;s online store nails it. This is what they do that makes it so good:</p>



<ul><li>A store for each country or area with prices in the local currency and accurate delivery estimates. Everything in the store is available to you. For an Australian, this is where Amazon falls down.</li>

<li>Free shipping on everything, no exceptions.</li>

<li>The fastest shipping available, no exceptions. You&#8217;re not forced to choose between a multitude of slightly different options, they don&#8217;t use shipping to cut costs, you simply get the fastest. I&#8217;ve had multiple situations where I&#8217;ve ordered something from the Apple online store at 3pm one day and had it arrive before 9am the next.</li>

<li>Two emails: the first one sent out immediately to confirm your order the next usually a few hours later confirming it&#8217;s been sent out that includes a link to the package tracking facility. I&#8217;ve had packages arrive from Ebay extremely quickly but without even a confirmation that they received my payment. Equally bad is an email every time your order is glanced at sideways.</li>

	        <h2 class="entry-title">Rehabilitation Observation</h2>
	      
			
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Situations are always interesting when a random sample of people are brought together and forced to interact. My rehabilitation program is a great example: eight people, half male, half female, discrete age groups, social status, referred from different places and working in a variety of fields.</p>



<p>Something that bothers me is people who complain about problems they can fix but choose not to solve for whatever reason. This kind of person is represented heavily in my group.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m not the typical patient in my program. My back problems have existed for 5 weeks, since breaking my bones, most others have chronic problems that have been around for years or even decades. Invariably back problems can be solved simply — with the right exercise, body mechanics, stretching and posture.</p>



<p>Some group members have been attending back and neck rehabilitation programs for years, temporarily solving their problems but relapsing when they get &#8220;too busy&#8221; to keep up their exercise and stretching. It&#8217;s expected that we&#8217;ll continue our floor and cardio exercises for at least an hour a day five times per week when the program is complete. There&#8217;s no one that hasn&#8217;t complained about the burden of having to exercise when they have so little time as it is while simultaneously complaining about back pain, the stress it causes and the things it prevents them doing.</p>



<p>The patient who seems to have the most day to day issues flat out refuses to give up wearing high heeled shoes despite the physio and occupational therapist&#8217;s dire warnings against them. Another just doesn&#8217;t like wearing shoes with good arch support. It blows my mind that these people are willing to enrol in a two week, full-time rehabilitation program but are totally unwilling to wear a different kind of shoe. I can&#8217;t imagine how frustrating it must be for doctors.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not limited to taking care and responsibility for their own well-being either. A consistent topic of conversation is how terrible the traffic is. I talk about how great it is living in the city, so close to the hospital and all other amenities. They turn their nose up, <em>&#8220;I could never live in the city&#8221;</em>. Meanwhile, they&#8217;re spending two hours a day stuck in stop start traffic, complaining bitterly about it and can&#8217;t find a single hour per day to look after their health.</p>



<p>The exercise physiologist asked me whether I&#8217;ll have the time to continue the floor exercise program after the two weeks. Of course I&#8217;ll have time because I rent an apartment very close to my workplace, I work sane hours and getting back to 100% health is <em>the most</em> important thing in my life. Without that, little else, including the type of shoe I wear, matters.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Often friends or family upon seeing my bedroom or computer setup comment on the &#8220;minimalism&#8221;. That description has never sat well with me. It&#8217;s not until I&#8217;ve started following minimalism blogs like <a href="http://minima.al3x.net/">Minima</a> and <a href="http://minimalmac.com/">Minimal Mac</a> that I&#8217;ve realised why.</p>



<p>What I&#8217;m striving for isn&#8217;t minimalism but simplicity. While simplicity is taking away all but the essentials I feel like minimalism is taking away all but the essentials <em>and then taking away more</em> merely for the sake of less at the cost of utility, convenience or comfort.</p>

I didn&#8217;t spend long enough with it to pass what could be called even a grossly uninformed judgement but one thing that did impress me imediately was this gorgeous default desktop wallpaper. <a href="http://static.jimwhimpey.com/images/betta.jpg">Download it yourself</a>.</p>

I&#8217;ve loved it for years but can&#8217;t articulate what it is I like so much about it. Despite ubiquitous availability on YouTube I just bought it on iTunes. It always feels good to pay for and own the things you love and appreciate.</p>
