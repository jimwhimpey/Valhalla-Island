  <div class="entry-content"><p>One HD, Australia&#8217;s new free-to-air 24 hour sports channel has been running similar but slightly different commercials. Same music, slow motion and single continuous shot but with the crowd in place and the colour removed. In a world of overly aggressive, awkward and plain uninteresting commercials these really stand out. <a href="http://www.kottke.org/09/05/the-other-drama">Kottke</a> has links to a few more and a side story.</p>

The Rose and Bernard scene which basically countered everything the show is based on — people running around with guns trying to save other people — was a superb moment. The finale alone made up for every slow, boring filler episode Lost has ever aired.</p>

	        <h2 class="entry-title">Moving out of Home</h2>
	      
			
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I lived too close to university to justify moving out of home when I started. Being a student, I couldn&#8217;t afford it anyway. So I ended up spending more time at home than most. I did get a taste of what living out of home was like when I spent a semester on student exchange in Canada but that&#8217;s a very different kind of being away from home.</p>



<p>At 21, it feels like moving out has been a long time coming but really, it&#8217;s probably just about right. After a week to settle in with our few possessions, learn which light switch does what and buying the stuff we were missing, I couldn&#8217;t be happier.</p>



<h3>The City</h3>



<p>The number one reason we needed to move out was to get closer to work. I was commuting 1 hour and 45 minutes <em>each way</em> and Kristin was spending only a little less than that, it was totally ridiculous and it ruled my life. Kristin works in the city, I work just outside. We ended up finding a place in the best part of one of our <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/96424511">selected green zones</a>.</p>



<p>It takes me 5 minutes to get to work. I ride a small segment of the Bicentennial Bikeway that runs parallel to the river and cross just one street. The only other crossing is handled by a tunnel.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re only 3km outside the city CBD, close enough to easily ride into town but far enough that we don&#8217;t get the city noise or smell. Our street is wide, quiet and full of trees, shared with the Queensland Boy Scouts HQ. We have the neighbourhood of a suburb but the convenience of the city&#8217;s facilities and infrastructure.  We&#8217;re in the Brooklyn to Brisbane&#8217;s Manhattan.</p>



<p>With the extra 3 and a half hours I have spare each day now I&#8217;ve picked up training again. I&#8217;ve found a great running track along the river out to the University of Queensland, a massive and beautiful campus where I&#8217;ve taken a swimming pool membership too. On a nice day I&#8217;ll see 100+ people walking or running the same track, on a bad day I&#8217;ll still see 50. I&#8217;m not used to seeing so many people out and I love it.</p>



<h3>The Apartment</h3>



<p>Our apartment is perfect. We&#8217;re on the second floor of a small apartment complex. We have two big bedrooms, a big ensuite, heaps of cupboard space, a big lounge room, balcony and kitchen with lots of windows everywhere. The walls and floors are thick, we never hear a peep from anyone else in the complex.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a little rough around the edges with some carpet stains, marks and chips on the walls, things like that. Those things don&#8217;t bother me. Other places we saw were much smaller, had less facilities, were in worse locations but had been freshly renovated so cost more than our apartment. Marks on the wall are cosmetic and don&#8217;t affect your standard or living the way a tiny ensuite, no cupboards or lack of outdoor space would.</p>



<h3>An Internet Connection</h3>



<p>We had the power turned on quickly. Getting internet connected hasn&#8217;t been so easy. It&#8217;s been 12 days now since I applied for <a href="http://www.iinet.net.au/index.html">iiNet</a> online. I chose them for their naked DSL (we don&#8217;t need or want to pay for a landline), reasonable bandwidth limits, unmetred iTunes and Xbox Live access and their good reviews. There&#8217;s been a number of problems getting it setup including my inability to understand much of what iiNet&#8217;s call centre staff are saying on the phone.</p>



<p>We have internet in the meantime using a borrowed Telstra 3G express card. It&#8217;s expensive, slow, has low bandwidth limits and it&#8217;s own set of problems like having to connect to it through an old PC laptop and an ad-hoc wireless network. I&#8217;m looking forward to putting these problems behind me, iiNet assure me the issues are being worked through.</p>



<h3>Things I&#8217;m Most Enjoying</h3>



<p>Cooking my own dinner or not cooking anything at all if I&#8217;m not hungry. Not having to sequester my things in a room but put them where they belong. It&#8217;s amazing how good it feels to keep all my drink bottles in the kitchen. There&#8217;s 1000 small things but the winner is simply having the time to train, relax, read and mess around on the computer again.</p>



<h3>Things I&#8217;m Missing</h3>



<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jimwhimpey/sets/72157605337276961/">My Dogs</a>, Billy and Jess.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I understand the desire to shower in the morning. It&#8217;s a nice, fresh way to wake yourself and start the day. I don&#8217;t understand <em>only</em> showering in the morning.</p>



<p>The day is when you get dirty. Bringing that dirt to bed then washing it off in the morning, just in time to get dirty again doesn&#8217;t make sense. The bed is clean, if you want to be clean the next day showering only at night is works because you don&#8217;t get dirty while you sleep.</p>



<p>If you hold water preservation goals and limit yourself to a single shower per day, the evening option has to be the way to go. Sleep clean, start the day clean.</p>

<p>This clip sums up what I love most about Comedy and Everything Else. They&#8217;re not afraid to go to the extremes of silly or the extremes of seriousness. They get angry, they relaxed, they go slow and go fast.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m sure you know people who flat out refuse to talk about anything even remotely serious, those people who treat anything outside the tiny bubble of their immediate environment or day to day life not their problem and shoot down attempts to bring it up. Just as you know people who frown on the silly, who stare down a joke and refuse to make light of a situation. Often it&#8217;s the same person, the same person left with a bland middle ground of no opinion, personality or fun.</p>



<p>Comedy and Everything Else do what they feel. Playing radio with funny drop ins isn&#8217;t too silly and condemning torture isn&#8217;t too serious. The silly parts are hilarious, the serious is thought-provoking.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s crazy to <em>still</em> be talking about IE6 but the reality of the problems it causes remain.</p>



<p>The idea that a website has to look <em>identical</em> in every browser, even at the expense of design in browsers that render a page correctly, is insane. No one but the developer looks at the same website in multiple browsers, if it looks different between them, no one knows (let alone cares).</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve always said that the <em>content</em>, the reason the user is at the website in the first place will always be available in IE6 whether it&#8217;s with display perfection, CSS bugs or no CSS at all. It&#8217;s not worth hours hacking your way to perfect cross-browser consistency in a browser that is fundamentally flawed when no IE6 user knows what it&#8217;s supposed to look like anyway.</p>



<p>With anything under my control the philosophy is to completely ignore IE6. I spend my time developing better websites for browsers that work and worst case scenario (the most common scenario) it doesn&#8217;t <em>look</em> &#8220;right&#8221; in IE6, big fucking deal.</p>



<p>The universal IE6 stylesheet is doing a little more than nothing and I think, gets the balance right.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote>I’m a guy who doesn’t see anything good having come from the Internet. Period. [the Internet has] created this notion that anyone can have whatever they want at any given time. It’s as if the stores on Madison Avenue were open 24 hours a day. They feel entitled. They say, ‘Give it to me now,’ and if you don’t give it to them for free, they’ll steal it.</blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwd.com/media-news/fashion-memopad/memo-pad-uniqlo-nabs-deyn-bad-internet-classic-martha-2136751?src=rss/recentstories/20090515#/article/media-news/fashion-memopad/memo-pad-uniqlo-nabs-deyn-bad-internet-classic-martha-2136751?page=2">Michael Lynton, CEO Sony Pictures Entertainment</a></p>



<p>This is an incredible quote and exactly the reason these companies are failing. Not only do they not <em>get</em> the internet, they&#8217;re hostile towards it. They&#8217;re so blinded by their view of the internet as an avenue for illegal activity at their company&#8217;s expense that they fail to see <em>any</em> good or opportunity at all.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s despite iTunes, an <em>internet-only</em> music retailer, hitting <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2008/04/03itunes.html">the number 1 spot for music retailers in the US</a> (internet or otherwise) now with completely DRM-free tracks. There&#8217;s a million reasons why iTunes is better than piracy, it&#8217;s more reliable, faster, better quality, more easily searchable, the meta data is complete and correct, etc. Not to mention that it&#8217;s the legal and <em>moral</em> option. <a href="http://www.marco.org/109607811">As Marco says</a>, do better than the pirates and people are happy to pay.</p>

<p>As a sidenote, Have a Beagle&#8217;s theme by <a href="http://autumn.welles.name/">Autumn Welles</a> is one of the best I&#8217;ve seen.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><img src="/assets/tumblr/oaQecruTZndzdtvhhjbSQtt1o1_500.jpg"/><br/><p>Six months after the first, my second <a href="http://www.money-band.com/">money band</a> shipment arrived today, the best wallet I&#8217;ve ever used. I accidentally ordered just a single band this time, which sucks considering the deteriorative nature of rubber bands and the time and cost of shipping to Australia.</p>



<p>The money band is the simplicity and low profile of a money clip without the pretension. Carrying so little is easy once you admit to yourself that you don&#8217;t need to keep every loyalty card, membership card and receipt you&#8217;ve ever acquired on you <em>all the time</em>. I&#8217;m down to 7 cards, 2 of which I haven&#8217;t used in weeks and I&#8217;ll drop from the group.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://achoiceinthematter.tumblr.com/">1001 things I want in a lover</a> is a tumblog that often features on Tumblr&#8217;s <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/popular">popular posts list</a>. Here&#8217;s a few typical post examples:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Someone who has my schedule memorized with the purpose of surprising me.</p>

  

  <p>Someone who thinks everything I do is adorable.</p>

  

  <p>Someone who thinks that I’m the best thing that ever happened.</p>

  

  <p>Someone who will always have my favorite cereal at their house every time I come over.</p>

  

  <p>Someone who teaches me something new everyday.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>I can&#8217;t stand this bullshit. You don&#8217;t want a lover, you want a butler. No person leading their own life does half this shit. No one is going to spend their life dedicated to indulging your every whim and doting on your every insecurity. And if they did, I guarantee you&#8217;d get bored of it quickly.</p>
