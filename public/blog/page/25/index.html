  <div class="entry-content"><p>I hadn&#8217;t realised until last night that I&#8217;d been getting to sleep easily since moving out. It took having a hard time getting to sleep last night to realise. Up until last night I had no internet connection (beyond edge on the phone) so before bed I&#8217;d watch TV, a movie or read. Yesterday my internet was connected and I was up (relatively) late on the computer before going straight to bed. Lying in bed my mind was left buzzing and it took an hour to get to sleep, despite getting to bed hours later than usual.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve always known a winding down period before bed made a big difference but never has it been so obviously proven as it was last night.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.thepunch.com.au/articles/Twitter-is-great-so-whats-the-next-big-thing">Yeah, Twitter’s great. But what’s the next big thing?</a></p><p>At work we <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/events/state-of-origin-09/">use Twitter</a> to supplement what we do traditionally (as far as the internet goes) and it works great. We&#8217;re always looking for <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/events/iran-social-media/">new ways</a> to use it and everyone loves it but <em>still</em>, like this article, my colleagues are obsessed with the next Twitter.</p>



<p>Fuck the next Twitter. Twitter <em>is</em> great and we have it <em>now</em>. Forget about what doesn&#8217;t exist yet and focus on making best use of what&#8217;s at our present disposal. Meanwhile be open to new things, don&#8217;t ignore anything because it isn&#8217;t popular yet but treat it on its merits. The only difference between Twitter now and Twitter three years ago is the amount of people writing it off as useless.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s been 4 weeks since signing up for <a href="http://iinet.net.au/naked-dsl/plans.html">iiNet Naked DSL</a>, my connection has been activated and my iiNet approved, brand new, $200 modem and router has arrived. I still don&#8217;t have access to the internet.</p>



<p>Another half an hour call to iiNet last night and it&#8217;s been narrowed down to my modem/router not functioning properly or the line to my apartment being dead. The modem is with a workmate to rule out whether it&#8217;s broken. Then I can call to get a work order created to fix the line into my apartment, which will take at least a week from the time the work order is confirmed.</p>



<p>This whole thing is getting beyond ridiculous, I chose Naked DSL because it doesn&#8217;t require a phone line thus cutting another company and step out of the process and supposedly <em>simplifying things</em>. At this point it looks like it&#8217;d take less time to totally cancel my month old Naked DSL application (which is apparently now active), sign up for a phone line and a standard ADSL2 plan with a different company.</p>

<p>Sidenote: The theme garden is quite full now and the current structure isn&#8217;t scaling well. I&#8217;m sure Tumblr is working on it but even permalinks in the form of in page anchors on the recent page would be nice in the mean time.</p>

	        <h2 class="entry-title">Moving out of Home</h2>
	      
			
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I lived too close to university to justify moving out of home when I started. Being a student, I couldn&#8217;t afford it anyway. So I ended up spending more time at home than most. I did get a taste of what living out of home was like when I spent a semester on student exchange in Canada but that&#8217;s a very different kind of being away from home.</p>



<p>At 21, it feels like moving out has been a long time coming but really, it&#8217;s probably just about right. After a week to settle in with our few possessions, learn which light switch does what and buying the stuff we were missing, I couldn&#8217;t be happier.</p>



<h3>The City</h3>



<p>The number one reason we needed to move out was to get closer to work. I was commuting 1 hour and 45 minutes <em>each way</em> and Kristin was spending only a little less than that, it was totally ridiculous and it ruled my life. Kristin works in the city, I work just outside. We ended up finding a place in the best part of one of our <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/96424511">selected green zones</a>.</p>



<p>It takes me 5 minutes to get to work. I ride a small segment of the Bicentennial Bikeway that runs parallel to the river and cross just one street. The only other crossing is handled by a tunnel.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re only 3km outside the city CBD, close enough to easily ride into town but far enough that we don&#8217;t get the city noise or smell. Our street is wide, quiet and full of trees, shared with the Queensland Boy Scouts HQ. We have the neighbourhood of a suburb but the convenience of the city&#8217;s facilities and infrastructure.  We&#8217;re in the Brooklyn to Brisbane&#8217;s Manhattan.</p>



<p>With the extra 3 and a half hours I have spare each day now I&#8217;ve picked up training again. I&#8217;ve found a great running track along the river out to the University of Queensland, a massive and beautiful campus where I&#8217;ve taken a swimming pool membership too. On a nice day I&#8217;ll see 100+ people walking or running the same track, on a bad day I&#8217;ll still see 50. I&#8217;m not used to seeing so many people out and I love it.</p>



<h3>The Apartment</h3>



<p>Our apartment is perfect. We&#8217;re on the second floor of a small apartment complex. We have two big bedrooms, a big ensuite, heaps of cupboard space, a big lounge room, balcony and kitchen with lots of windows everywhere. The walls and floors are thick, we never hear a peep from anyone else in the complex.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a little rough around the edges with some carpet stains, marks and chips on the walls, things like that. Those things don&#8217;t bother me. Other places we saw were much smaller, had less facilities, were in worse locations but had been freshly renovated so cost more than our apartment. Marks on the wall are cosmetic and don&#8217;t affect your standard or living the way a tiny ensuite, no cupboards or lack of outdoor space would.</p>



<h3>An Internet Connection</h3>



<p>We had the power turned on quickly. Getting internet connected hasn&#8217;t been so easy. It&#8217;s been 12 days now since I applied for <a href="http://www.iinet.net.au/index.html">iiNet</a> online. I chose them for their naked DSL (we don&#8217;t need or want to pay for a landline), reasonable bandwidth limits, unmetred iTunes and Xbox Live access and their good reviews. There&#8217;s been a number of problems getting it setup including my inability to understand much of what iiNet&#8217;s call centre staff are saying on the phone.</p>



<p>We have internet in the meantime using a borrowed Telstra 3G express card. It&#8217;s expensive, slow, has low bandwidth limits and it&#8217;s own set of problems like having to connect to it through an old PC laptop and an ad-hoc wireless network. I&#8217;m looking forward to putting these problems behind me, iiNet assure me the issues are being worked through.</p>



<h3>Things I&#8217;m Most Enjoying</h3>



<p>Cooking my own dinner or not cooking anything at all if I&#8217;m not hungry. Not having to sequester my things in a room but put them where they belong. It&#8217;s amazing how good it feels to keep all my drink bottles in the kitchen. There&#8217;s 1000 small things but the winner is simply having the time to train, relax, read and mess around on the computer again.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><img src="/assets/tumblr/oaQecruTZnwmvj76eIqPvf7wo1_r1_500.jpg"/><br/><p>With every Mac laptop revision the trackpad has grown to the point where the difference between the iBook G4 and new aluminium Macbook trackpads is massive. It may be a case of what I&#8217;m used to but Mac trackpads are the only I&#8217;ve ever found usable. In Apple fashion, they continue to make good, better.</p>
