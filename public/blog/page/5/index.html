<p>This is one of my favourite things about road cycling. At the end of a tough 6 or 7 hour ride you revert to your most basic instincts. Food, drink and rest become all you can think about and indulging them feels like the highest satisfaction you will ever achieve.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://andyrutledge.com/news-redux.php">Andy Rutledge: News Redux</a></p><p>Rutledge&#8217;s online news redux has been linked around the internet like crazy this week and is of particular interest to me as someone who works on <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/">a news website</a> for a living.</p>



<p>The most frustrating thing about reading the responses is the way it&#8217;s being treated as nothing more than an unsolicited NY Times redesign. This is not the case:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>As with all of my previous redux efforts, this one is not a specific suggestion for how to precisely redesign a specific site. It’s just an exercise to discuss and examine specific issues via quickly-conceived, hastily-constructed visual comps.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>The comps are just illustrations of his points. Everyone is ignoring this.</p>



<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, I find the NY Times homepage impossible to use. It&#8217;s like staring into a bowl of alphabet soup looking for words. Rutledge&#8217;s comp looks like something I want to use, his points make sense and resonate with me.</p>



<p>Gruber <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/07/27/news-site-design">linked</a> to <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2011/07/designing-a-big-news-site-is-about-more-than-beauty/">a response</a> by Joshua Benton which perfectly demonstrates the thought pattern that creates these shambles in the first place.</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Similarly, stripping stories down to just headlines — no intro text, which Rutledge dislikes for some reason, no thumbnails — may maximize typographic beauty, but it doesn’t do much for enticing a click.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>As Gruber pointed out, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_per_impression">CPM advertising</a> is a disease eating these websites from the inside out. Even at my place of work, a non-commercial operation, a click is valued highly because page visits are considered markers of success. This is the <em>wrong metric</em>. Attention, engagement, satisfaction and loyalty should define success.</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Rutledge’s design, on a commonly sized laptop screen (1440×990), would link to exactly three stories in the first screenful of content. The Times’ current Politics page links to 13.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>People know how to scroll. People can&#8217;t read 13 stories at once. People can&#8217;t click on 13 stories at once. Respect your users by treating them like they know how to use a computer. Treat them like <em>humans</em>. How many stories does the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/images/2011/07/29/nytfrontpage/scan.jpg">print edition of today&#8217;s NY Times</a>  have above the fold (the real one)? <strong>Three</strong>.</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>The Times generates a ton of content every day. Looking at Times Wire, I see 169 stories published just in the past 18 hours — and I don’t believe that’s actually capturing everything that flows through the Times’ blogs and sundry other online spaces.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Having a lot of something is only reason to organise more effectively, and reason against dumping the whole lot in the one place. The NY Time&#8217;s homepage says to me: &#8220;we have <em>a lot</em> of content, too much for us to deal with it, here it all is, <em>you</em> deal with it&#8221;.</p>



<p>Paul Scrivens <a href="http://journal.drawar.com/d/redesigning-and-re-thinking-the-news/">sees it</a>:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Instead of trying to narrow down what content needs to be shown on the homepage, they try to find ways to ensure that all content is shown on the homepage.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Khoi, previous director of design at nytimes.com, ended up <a href="http://www.subtraction.com/2011/07/28/unsolicited-redesigns">responding</a> to the piece but unfortunately dealt with it as nothing more than a redesign, just as everyone else.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll close with something I think is important and for which a trend seems to be starting. Newspapers aren&#8217;t expensive but they&#8217;re not free. Rutledge is all for paid subscriptions, as am I:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Quality news is valuable. It must therefore have a cost. Quality news is subscription only. You pay for valuable information. Fluff you get for free.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Making something people want to buy has been the way newspapers have worked (and <em>flourished</em>) for over 100 years. It&#8217;s baffling why they&#8217;re <a href="http://bradcolbow.com/archive/view/the_brads_this_is_why_your_newspaper_is_dying/">abandoning it</a> <em>to their detriment</em> as soon as they step onto the web.</p>

It was probably participating in that race which most severely hampered his bid for the 2010 yellow jersey.</p>



<p>This year he raced the much more sedate Tour de Romandie (and won) in preparation. This year, his 7th year, at 34 years old, Cadel Evans won the Tour de France.</p>



<p>He is an emotional man who struggles with the spoken word and media attention but whose legs and heart could not have communicated with more clarity over the last three weeks and last two years. His victory and the way he did it fill me with pride as an Australian and cycling fan.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote>Unfortunately we know vandalism of school property is an all-too-common problem. From my standpoint as Prime Minister and someone very passionate about a high-quality education, we want kids to have the benefits of all the resources in our schools and we don&#8217;t want to see these wanton acts of destruction in any school.</blockquote><p>Julia Gillard in response to <a href="http://abc.net.au/news/2011-07-18/unley-school-fire-arrests/2798262">vandals setting fire to her old school</a>.</p>



<p>This quote highlights the worst thing about Gillard. Every fucking word that comes out of her mouth is monotonous, politicised nothing speak. <em>Kids burnt your school</em>, far out, show some emotion.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s just like last week, when she was <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-07-13/woman-confronts-julia-gillard-over-carbon-tax/2793462">confronted in a shopping centre</a> by someone with a legitimate question who (unlike most Australians) was well informed on this issue. In my ideal world Gillard would tell the woman, &#8220;yes, I said I wouldn&#8217;t do this previously but now I have more information, it&#8217;s a three year stepping stone and <em>it&#8217;s the right thing to do</em>&#8221;. Instead she completely ignores the words the woman is saying and just repeats the party line. To her credit the woman doesn&#8217;t want any of it and makes the situation awkward.</p>



<p>I can somewhat understand the meaningless political babble being told to the lazy press but when you&#8217;re one on one with a voter telling you they understand <em>what the carbon tax is</em> and Gillard just repeats the same &#8220;we&#8217;re implementing a carbon tax for the 500 big polluters blah blah blah&#8221; I question whether she&#8217;s actually a robot dressed as a human.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><img src="/assets/tumblr/tumblr_lobk3toUMb1qzwfbio1_500.jpg"/><br/><p>As a cyclist, a cycling fan and an Australian this photo fills me to overflowing with feelings of reverence. It was taken a couple of hundred metres from the finish line of this year&#8217;s Tour de France stage 4 and I can&#8217;t stop looking at it.</p>



<p>Cadel won the stage by a few centimetres by delivering a sustained attack so vicious that neither Alberto Contador, undisputedly the best climber in the world, nor Philippe Gilbert, a man who just months ago swept the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ardennes_classics">Ardennes classics</a> by destroying the rest of the field on uphill finishes exactly like this one, could come around him.</p>



<p>Those faces belong to two of the most dominant men, not only in cycling, but in this specific kind of finish and they are <em>in pain</em>. Not once this year in any of Gilbert&#8217;s destructive Ardennes wins or throughout Contador&#8217;s Giro dominance did they look like <em>that</em>. Cadel, an Australian, is on the front, determination contorting his face and body, forcing <em>the best</em> to turn themselves inside out for at most, a second place.</p>



<p>It is glorious.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote>In the past decade or so, researchers have produced a significant body of research measuring the dreadfulness of a long commute. People with long transit times suffer from disproportionate pain, stress, obesity, and dissatisfaction. The joy of living in a big, exurban house, or that extra income leftover from your cheap rent? It is almost certainly not worth it.</blockquote><p>Slate <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2295603/">states the obvious</a> about the shittiness of long commutes in <em>only</em> 1000 words.</p>



<p>This is why every dollar (of the many) I spend on my apartment, a ~5 minute bike ride from work, is money well spent. Each day I bypass gridlocked traffic on Coronation Drive while cruising along the riverside bikeway. What good is your big house, big backyard or the extra money* in your pocket when so much of the time you could be spending enjoying those things is instead spent in traffic?</p>



<p>Ridiculous beyond belief is the phenomenon of purchasing a luxury car with the money you save by living in the suburbs so the two hours you have to spend in a car each day are more enjoyable. A supreme example of solving the wrong problem.</p>



<p>* When you remove the cost of car ownership (insurance, registration, maintenance), tolls, fuel and parking the perceived increased cost of living is probably false.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote>Unlike blogging, where you spend time thinking carefully about what you say in each post, Tumblr is really more [&#8230;]</blockquote><p>This is the start of a quote <a href="http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/319838/retention-selfexpression-tumblr">from here</a> that was bizarely posted on the <a href="http://staff.tumblr.com/post/5834845378/unlike-blogging-where-you-spend-time-thinking">Tumblr Staff blog</a>.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s right Tumblr users, Tumblr is not for <em>thinking carefully about what you say</em>. I think about leaving Tumblr more and more every day.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I always found it a bit strange that such a thing would be an explicit criteria on every advertised job vacancy. That was before I entered the workforce. Every day I&#8217;m further astonished by people&#8217;s inability to not just articulate themselves but string a sentence together that makes any sense at all. Combined with a complete lack of brevity I spend so much time either deciphering or slogging through something that can be said with 1/10th the words.</p>

	        <h2 class="entry-title">The Truly Silent Phone</h2>
	      
			
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I don&#8217;t like the concept of phones. It shouldn&#8217;t be socially acceptable to interrupt anyone at any time with a demand for their complete attention. That said, situations exist where information is important enough to warrant interruption.</p>



<p>To partly deal with it I rarely had my phone set to anything but silent. In reality &#8220;silent&#8221; mode with vibration on is actually quite loud and jarring, much more jarring than many ringtones and especially if your phone is sitting on a hard surface. Even in a pocket I find the vibration more of a shock than a vibration-less ringtone.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s only recently that I identified anxiety attached my ringing and vibrating phone and the attention it demanded. So I decided that as well as permanent silent mode I&#8217;d turn off vibrate and I haven&#8217;t looked back, it&#8217;s a joy.</p>



<p>If my phone is in view the most notification I get of a call or text is a lit up screen. Much less distracting and more easily ignored than a loud ring or vibrate. If it&#8217;s not in view I get <em>no notification at all</em>. Even when in view I get zero notification of new email, an added bonus.</p>



<p>Sure I miss a lot of calls but in a couple of months it&#8217;s never mattered, people leave a message and can wait until I next check my phone and I&#8217;m free to call. If I&#8217;m expecting a call and my phone isn&#8217;t within peripheral vision I&#8217;ll temporarily turn off silent mode.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a simple change and it may sound dramatic but it feels liberating.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yet another calendar application which doesn&#8217;t address <a href="http://valhallaisland.com/post/1120483557">my</a> and <a href="http://www.marco.org/2010/03/28/more-ideas-than-time-logarithmic-calendar-view">Marco&#8217;s</a> biggest issue. Fantastical is certainly a nice supplement to iCal but it&#8217;s a shame that it&#8217;s a menu bar app (which I don&#8217;t like in general) and its scope is so limited.</p>
