  <div class="entry-content"><p>Alex Steffen makes the eloquent case against simply using clean energy to solve our climate problem.</p>



<p>This explains why, even if electric cars were readily available and they could be charged on 100% clean energy I have very little interest in owning one despite not owning a car now partially for environmental reasons. I would much rather (and do) live close to the things I need and want to do. Electric or not, cars are backed up from my house to the city each morning. I pass hundreds of gridlocked cars on my 7 minute bike ride to work, they&#8217;re already unsustainable.</p>



<p>He ends with this great quote:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Because right now our economy by and large operates as Paul Hawkins said by stealing the future, selling it in the present and calling it GDP.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over the weekend I managed to drop my iPhone 4 on concrete before immediately stomping on it just to make sure it was properly smashed. I&#8217;m not too bothered because my contract ends in a month and I would be getting a new iPhone (hopefully an iPhone 5) for no extra money. Until that time I have a borrowed 3GS and some observations:</p>



<ul><li>The screen is <em>horrible</em>. It&#8217;s amazing how quickly I got used to and proceed to take the Retina Display for granted.</li>

<li>The camera is also crappy. The iPhone 4 camera rivals any point and shoot I&#8217;ve ever used, the 3GS camera is a very much a phone camera.</li>

<li>The 3GS hardware doesn&#8217;t look as good as the iPhone 4 hardware but it feels <em>much</em> nicer in the hand.</li>

</ul><p>Those a really the only differences. The 3GS is still a great phone and I can see why Apple is still selling it.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://andyrutledge.com/news-redux.php">Andy Rutledge: News Redux</a></p><p>Rutledge&#8217;s online news redux has been linked around the internet like crazy this week and is of particular interest to me as someone who works on <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/">a news website</a> for a living.</p>



<p>The most frustrating thing about reading the responses is the way it&#8217;s being treated as nothing more than an unsolicited NY Times redesign. This is not the case:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>As with all of my previous redux efforts, this one is not a specific suggestion for how to precisely redesign a specific site. It’s just an exercise to discuss and examine specific issues via quickly-conceived, hastily-constructed visual comps.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>The comps are just illustrations of his points. Everyone is ignoring this.</p>



<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, I find the NY Times homepage impossible to use. It&#8217;s like staring into a bowl of alphabet soup looking for words. Rutledge&#8217;s comp looks like something I want to use, his points make sense and resonate with me.</p>



<p>Gruber <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/07/27/news-site-design">linked</a> to <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2011/07/designing-a-big-news-site-is-about-more-than-beauty/">a response</a> by Joshua Benton which perfectly demonstrates the thought pattern that creates these shambles in the first place.</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Similarly, stripping stories down to just headlines — no intro text, which Rutledge dislikes for some reason, no thumbnails — may maximize typographic beauty, but it doesn’t do much for enticing a click.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>As Gruber pointed out, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_per_impression">CPM advertising</a> is a disease eating these websites from the inside out. Even at my place of work, a non-commercial operation, a click is valued highly because page visits are considered markers of success. This is the <em>wrong metric</em>. Attention, engagement, satisfaction and loyalty should define success.</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Rutledge’s design, on a commonly sized laptop screen (1440×990), would link to exactly three stories in the first screenful of content. The Times’ current Politics page links to 13.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>People know how to scroll. People can&#8217;t read 13 stories at once. People can&#8217;t click on 13 stories at once. Respect your users by treating them like they know how to use a computer. Treat them like <em>humans</em>. How many stories does the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/images/2011/07/29/nytfrontpage/scan.jpg">print edition of today&#8217;s NY Times</a>  have above the fold (the real one)? <strong>Three</strong>.</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>The Times generates a ton of content every day. Looking at Times Wire, I see 169 stories published just in the past 18 hours — and I don’t believe that’s actually capturing everything that flows through the Times’ blogs and sundry other online spaces.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Having a lot of something is only reason to organise more effectively, and reason against dumping the whole lot in the one place. The NY Time&#8217;s homepage says to me: &#8220;we have <em>a lot</em> of content, too much for us to deal with it, here it all is, <em>you</em> deal with it&#8221;.</p>



<p>Paul Scrivens <a href="http://journal.drawar.com/d/redesigning-and-re-thinking-the-news/">sees it</a>:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Instead of trying to narrow down what content needs to be shown on the homepage, they try to find ways to ensure that all content is shown on the homepage.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Khoi, previous director of design at nytimes.com, ended up <a href="http://www.subtraction.com/2011/07/28/unsolicited-redesigns">responding</a> to the piece but unfortunately dealt with it as nothing more than a redesign, just as everyone else.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll close with something I think is important and for which a trend seems to be starting. Newspapers aren&#8217;t expensive but they&#8217;re not free. Rutledge is all for paid subscriptions, as am I:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Quality news is valuable. It must therefore have a cost. Quality news is subscription only. You pay for valuable information. Fluff you get for free.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Making something people want to buy has been the way newspapers have worked (and <em>flourished</em>) for over 100 years. It&#8217;s baffling why they&#8217;re <a href="http://bradcolbow.com/archive/view/the_brads_this_is_why_your_newspaper_is_dying/">abandoning it</a> <em>to their detriment</em> as soon as they step onto the web.</p>

It was probably participating in that race which most severely hampered his bid for the 2010 yellow jersey.</p>



<p>This year he raced the much more sedate Tour de Romandie (and won) in preparation. This year, his 7th year, at 34 years old, Cadel Evans won the Tour de France.</p>



<p>He is an emotional man who struggles with the spoken word and media attention but whose legs and heart could not have communicated with more clarity over the last three weeks and last two years. His victory and the way he did it fill me with pride as an Australian and cycling fan.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote>Unfortunately we know vandalism of school property is an all-too-common problem. From my standpoint as Prime Minister and someone very passionate about a high-quality education, we want kids to have the benefits of all the resources in our schools and we don&#8217;t want to see these wanton acts of destruction in any school.</blockquote><p>Julia Gillard in response to <a href="http://abc.net.au/news/2011-07-18/unley-school-fire-arrests/2798262">vandals setting fire to her old school</a>.</p>



<p>This quote highlights the worst thing about Gillard. Every fucking word that comes out of her mouth is monotonous, politicised nothing speak. <em>Kids burnt your school</em>, far out, show some emotion.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s just like last week, when she was <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-07-13/woman-confronts-julia-gillard-over-carbon-tax/2793462">confronted in a shopping centre</a> by someone with a legitimate question who (unlike most Australians) was well informed on this issue. In my ideal world Gillard would tell the woman, &#8220;yes, I said I wouldn&#8217;t do this previously but now I have more information, it&#8217;s a three year stepping stone and <em>it&#8217;s the right thing to do</em>&#8221;. Instead she completely ignores the words the woman is saying and just repeats the party line. To her credit the woman doesn&#8217;t want any of it and makes the situation awkward.</p>



<p>I can somewhat understand the meaningless political babble being told to the lazy press but when you&#8217;re one on one with a voter telling you they understand <em>what the carbon tax is</em> and Gillard just repeats the same &#8220;we&#8217;re implementing a carbon tax for the 500 big polluters blah blah blah&#8221; I question whether she&#8217;s actually a robot dressed as a human.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><img src="/assets/tumblr/tumblr_lobk3toUMb1qzwfbio1_500.jpg"/><br/><p>As a cyclist, a cycling fan and an Australian this photo fills me to overflowing with feelings of reverence. It was taken a couple of hundred metres from the finish line of this year&#8217;s Tour de France stage 4 and I can&#8217;t stop looking at it.</p>



<p>Cadel won the stage by a few centimetres by delivering a sustained attack so vicious that neither Alberto Contador, undisputedly the best climber in the world, nor Philippe Gilbert, a man who just months ago swept the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ardennes_classics">Ardennes classics</a> by destroying the rest of the field on uphill finishes exactly like this one, could come around him.</p>



<p>Those faces belong to two of the most dominant men, not only in cycling, but in this specific kind of finish and they are <em>in pain</em>. Not once this year in any of Gilbert&#8217;s destructive Ardennes wins or throughout Contador&#8217;s Giro dominance did they look like <em>that</em>. Cadel, an Australian, is on the front, determination contorting his face and body, forcing <em>the best</em> to turn themselves inside out for at most, a second place.</p>



<p>It is glorious.</p>

It&#8217;s mind boggling the extent to which Hywood doesn&#8217;t get it. He calls Fairfax&#8217;s iPad app &#8220;our iPad&#8221;, &#8220;there&#8217;s been 100,000 downloads of our iPad&#8221;. And I like this quote:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>If you look at the old business, the old business didn&#8217;t really <em>need</em> the journalism.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Now there&#8217;s an imperative to produce quality journalism these media companies are really struggling.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There are three small things that make <a href="http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific">Twitterrific for Mac</a> my choice over the official <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/au/app/twitter/id409789998?mt=12">Twitter for Mac</a>:</p>



<ol><li>Twitterrific does not automatically shorten every URL I post regardless of length. I want people to know what I&#8217;m linking to.</li>

<li>Twitterrific inserts the URL of an uploaded image into the tweet body rather than as an invisible &#8220;attachment&#8221;. I want to choose where my image URL goes.</li>

<li>Twitterrific has an option for turning off the dock icon.</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote>People who can code in the world of technology companies are a dime a dozen and get no respect. People who can code in biology, medicine, government, sociology, physics, history, and mathematics are respected and can do amazing things to advance those disciplines.</blockquote><p>Zed A. Shaw as part of <a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/advice.html">more wise words</a> about the art, pursuit and profession of programming. This is something I think about a lot.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote>Not far from where I used to live there was a large area set aside for a cemetery but it was developed into a golf course instead. It would have been more useful to make it a cemetery.</blockquote><p>A commenter on <a href="http://abc.net.au/news/stories/2011/06/13/3242400.htm">this story about running out of grave sites</a>.</p>



<p>I think a golf course is a pretty inefficient and indulgent use of land but to suggest that using the land to store slowly decomposing bodies at regular intervals is <em>better</em> boggles my mind.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote>You know all the races the team&#8217;s performance was good but all the results were shit. And we didn&#8217;t know the answer for that.
