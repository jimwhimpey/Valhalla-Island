  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.farbeyondthestars.com/57-things/">The Less You Have, The More Epic Your Life</a></p><p>Everett Bogue owns just 57 things. After reading the list you might wonder how he brushes his teeth, washes himself or his clothes, cooks food, cleans his accommodation, where he sits, what he sleeps on, how he keeps food frozen, what he eats from or with or how he pumps up his bike tyres.</p>



<p>The answer to a lot of those questions seems to be he lives with someone and they obviously have a lot of shared items that facilitate these necessities of life. I&#8217;d say that invalidates the 57 things count but maybe, like the underwear disclaimer, it&#8217;s one of the unspoken rules of the minimalist blogger:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>I’m counting my underwear and socks together because every other minimalist blogger does too. We’re allowed to cheat on undergarments because we always have.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Irrefutable logic.</p>



<p>Pretend for a minute that he really only has 57 things in the way it&#8217;s being sold. As I&#8217;ve <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/160357037">written before</a>, simplicity not minimalism should be the goal. There is no inherent good in minimalism. Owning a toothbrush is not a burden <em>plus</em> it makes it very easy to brush my teeth when the time comes twice a day.</p>



<p>As with many things Bike Snob <a href="http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2010/08/new-smugness-keeping-it-to-minimum.html">sums it up</a> using minimal words:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>[…] at what point is the effort involved ultimately less simple than simply having the stuff?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/compare/pc-vs-mac.aspx">Mac vs. PC by Microsoft</a></p><p>Observations:</p>



<ul><li>The centrepiece of the page is stock photography.</li>

<li>&#8220;Working hard&#8221; is one of their selling points.</li>

<li>&#8220;Macs can take time to learn&#8221;.</li>

<li>Three of the six areas mention Office incompatibilities, software Microsoft also releases for the Mac.</li>

<li>Lots of &#8220;mays&#8221; and &#8220;mights&#8221;. Nothing substantiated, just planting seeds of doubt.</li>

</ul><p>The difference in each campaign embodies the difference in each company on the whole. Apple sell the Mac&#8217;s advantages, Microsoft sell the Mac&#8217;s potential disadvantages. Offence vs. defence.</p>



<p>Beside that, the whole thing is just full of inaccuracies or exaggerations designed to scare:</p>



<ul><li>&#8220;And Macs can&#8217;t connect to an Xbox 360&#8221;. I connect to my Xbox from my iMac almost daily.</li>

<li>&#8221;[&#8230;] the mouse works differently&#8221;. Not true.</li>

<li>&#8220;With a Mac, it&#8217;s harder to set up secure sharing for your photos, music &amp; movies, documents, and even printers with other computers on your home network.&#8221; Not true.</li>

<li>&#8220;On a Mac, you have to manually set up photo sharing, manually set up music and movie sharing, manually set up file sharing, and manually set up printer sharing.&#8221; That&#8217;s true, each involves clicking a check box.</li>

	        <h2 class="entry-title">Boot Camps</h2>
	      
			
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>A week in the life of many I see every Saturday morning:</p>



<ol><li>Always take the lift instead of the stairs.</li>

<li>Treat escalators like rides.</li>

<li>Watch 3 hours of TV each evening.</li>

<li>Drive <em>everywhere</em>, even the shortest of distances.</li>

<li>Join a group of 10 others on Saturday morning to attend a $20, 1 hour bootcamp involving relentless, unpleasant physical activity while being yelled at by a personal trainer.</li>

<li>Suffer an injury.</li>

<li>Sore all over, spend the next five days doing nothing while you recover.</li>

<li>Associate exercise with terrible things, resent it.</li>

</ol><p>Exercise needs to be a part of life. It doesn&#8217;t work as a chore you do to top up your fitness every couple of weeks. When it is treated that way with things like boot camps the negatives it produces in the form of injuries, exhaustion for days and negative connotations with exercise totally outweigh any benefit from a one hour workout.</p>



<p>Keeping fit and healthy is simple: find a physical activity you love. For me it&#8217;s cycling, for you it could be tennis, swimming, rowing, boxing, skipping, dancing or walking though the park. The physical benefits become a side effect of something you love doing in any case.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Bike Snob, as he does so often, strikes to the heart of an issue with casual cycling parlance. Here on a big <a href="http://travel.nytimes.com/2010/08/01/travel/01Biking.html?pagewanted=1&amp;src=twt&amp;twt=nytimes">bicycle tour &#8220;holiday&#8221; through the desert</a>:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Ideally, we would not need such vacations, instead weaving strands of responsibility and pleasure into the laterally stiff yet vertically compliant crabon fribé of a balanced life.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>This is the way I feel about all holidays. One recurring memory from my childhood is my Mum working her butt off (and getting appropriately stressed) to have everything organised in time for us to take a holiday.</p>



<p>In my year and a half of working full time I&#8217;ve taken very little leave and almost none in big blocks. Yet I&#8217;ve never felt overworked, stressed or like I need to take a holiday. I work sane hours and lead a rich life outside of work. Everyone is doing it wrong.</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>&#8220;Across the Sea&#8221;, the Jacob/Man in Black flashback episode, is the break-up.</p>

  

  <p>For some, I suspect the series finale was the make-up sex.</p>

  

  <p>For me, the series finale was like being forced to watch my six-year lover blow another guy.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>For me it was make up sex followed by an empty feeling a couple of days after I&#8217;d realised what I&#8217;d done. Nonetheless, a bad breakup doesn&#8217;t nullify 6 years of good times.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.marco.org/868606627">Marco Arment</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p>Today’s overdue Mac Pro update is a welcome change, but for a computer that’s so expensive, why not just get an iMac?</p></blockquote>



<p>This is exactly the question I faced when upgrading to my current computer, a low specced 27&#8221; iMac. Three things weighed most heavily into my decision:</p>



<ul><li>A lowest end Mac Pro plus a cinema display is <em>way more</em> expensive than a lowest end iMac. The higher the specs on each model the lower the margin but I have no need for extreme performance.</li>

<li>Six months ago you couldn&#8217;t buy a 27&#8221; LED display outside of an iMac.</li>

<li>Unlike previous generation iMacs and thanks to the wonders of DisplayPort I can use use the iMac&#8217;s display as an external display for a Mac Pro in the future.</li>

</ul><p>So come 6 or 12 months when my low specced iMac starts to feel unbearably slow I&#8217;ll buy a Mac Pro and reap the benefits Marco lists while keeping the most valuable part of the iMac. There&#8217;ll be a computer sitting on the back of the iMac not doing anything but that&#8217;s a small write off.</p>

<p>Car manufactures will be doing backflips and punters will be stoked they can buy an expensive car even further out of their means.</p>



<p>A good time to remind my Australian readers that <a href="http://greens.org.au/">the Greens</a> are the only responsible way to vote in the upcoming election.

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>So <a href="http://blogs.consumerreports.org/electronics/2010/07/apple-iphone-4-antenna-issue-iphone4-problems-dropped-calls-lab-test-confirmed-problem-issues-signal-strength-att-network-gsm.html">Consumer Reports can&#8217;t recommend the iPhone 4</a>.</p>



<p>And the iPhone 4 is <a href="http://digitaldaily.allthingsd.com/20100712/consumer-reports-by-the-way-the-iphone-4-is-also-the-best-smartphone-on-the-market/">Consumer Reports highest rated smart phone</a>.</p>



<p>I am as excited about getting Consumer Reports highest rated phone today as I was the day it was released. Why?</p>



<ol><li>On the whole, reception is <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/07/13/yes-the-iphone-4-is-broken-no-the-iphone-4-is-not-broken/">way better than previous iPhones</a>. Many are reporting if they try really hard they can reproduce the problem but in real world use they&#8217;re dropping <em>far fewer calls</em> with the iPhone 4 (I should stop right here, it&#8217;s all that matters).</li>

<li>The &#8220;problem&#8221; is 100% solved with a case or <a href="http://www.marco.org/733115343">small piece of tape</a> (and that&#8217;s probably a much bigger piece than what&#8217;s actually required).</li>

<li>It&#8217;s Consumer Reports <em>highest rated phone</em>. Higher even than Consumer Reports second highest rated phone, the iPhone 3GS, a phone with no reception issue hysteria.</li>

</ol><p>Then there&#8217;s the flakey proximity sensor issue the likes of which <a href="http://log.maniacalrage.net/post/763449236/update-on-iphone-4-issues-part-ii">Garrett Murray is experiencing</a>.</p>



<p>What a fantastic reason to use the hands free headphones and not hold a microwave transmitter next to your brain. Even if the <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2010/05/17/2901641.htm">link isn&#8217;t clear</a> it&#8217;s not worth the risk.</p>



<p>The only thing that frustrates me about these issues is that it&#8217;s obviously delaying the iPhone 4&#8217;s release in Australia.</p>



<p>It&#8217;ll be interesting to see what Apple announces at its <a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2010/07/14/apple-to-hold-special-iphone-4-press-conference-on-friday/">Friday press conference</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><img src="/assets/tumblr/tumblr_l5cbra3ndO1qzwfbio1_500.jpg"/><br/><p>Today I saw the <a href="http://qag.qld.gov.au/exhibitions/current/ron_mueck">Ron Mueck exhibition at the Queensland GoMA</a>. Months after the exhibition opened it was still crowded and rightfully so, the pieces are surreal.</p>



<p>It didn&#8217;t even occur to me to take a camera but it seemed the huge majority of patrons were taking photos. Flash photography wasn&#8217;t allowed but many were using flashes anyway (I think most people have no idea  how to turn their flash off nor want to know how). People were moving to a piece, taking a number of photos from different angles, moving to the next and shooting again. There were more camera phones than point and shoots and there were no SLRs.</p>



<p>There are <a href="http://www.google.com.au/images?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=ron%20mueck&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;redir_esc=&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;hl=en&amp;tab=wi">many photos of Ron Mueck&#8217;s work online</a>.</p>



<p>I genuinely want to know what&#8217;s going through people&#8217;s minds when each individual from a group of three is documenting the exhibit with their own terrible phone camera. For what reason are they doing it? To go back and reminisce about that time they went to the art gallery and took photographs? To prove to others that they went? To enjoy the art all over again to make up for what they missed while they were <em>actually there</em>?</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t get it.</p>

The speed isn&#8217;t earth shattering, as it wasn&#8217;t on 3.x, but it&#8217;s definitely back to pre-iOS 4 levels. I&#8217;d been really resenting the iOS 4 update and had been dying for the iPhone 4 to be released in Australia up until now.

<p>It wasn&#8217;t until I was about 4 hours in that I realised how similar it is to the <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/">Valhalla Island</a> design structurally. I think the 500 pixel wide limit on photo post images in Tumblr somewhat dictates things.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>An English couple are <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/07/06/2945557.htm">under fire for letting kids cycle to school</a>. It&#8217;s a 1500m route along footpaths that the parents have taught their children. The most &#8220;dangerous&#8221; part involves crossing one road manned by a lollipop lady.</p>



<p>Needless to say, this is madness. I started cycling to school from grade 2 and I still remember the liberation I felt being able to ride to school and friend&#8217;s houses. There was a huge bike lockup at my primary school which was always filled to the brim with bikes.</p>



<p>Ironically, it&#8217;s the convoy of automobiles carrying one child each and the infrastructure to support it at the expense of safer bike and pedestrian facilities that make such independence at all dangerous to begin with. No primary school kid wearing a helmet is going to die in even a bike on bike accident. I fell off my bike more times than I can remember riding to and from school, a little road rash does nothing but teach kids how to deal with crises, albeit small ones, independently.</p>



<p>It seems that even in the 12 years since I was in primary school such freedom has been eradicated. I&#8217;d be very interested to go back to my primary school to see how full the bike rack is now.</p>

	        <h2 class="entry-title">iOS 4 Let Down</h2>
	      
			
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>There were <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/717434547">four new features</a> I was looking forward to in iOS. Unfortunately the iPhone 3G only gets two of them.</p>



<p>The 3G doesn&#8217;t have the power to support multi-tasking so the fast app switching widget isn&#8217;t included, unfortunately the iPhone orientation lock is part of the fast app switching widget and also excluded. Bluetooth keyboard support just isn&#8217;t there.</p>



<p>Worse than the missing features I was most looking forward to is the slow down of the system in general. This release has obviously erred on the side of providing a better experience to the more powerful 3GS and 4.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s one feature of one application which has particularly suffered. Unfortunately it&#8217;s my favourite feature of my most used iPhone application: tilt scrolling in <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a>. Under iOS 4 it&#8217;s severely jaggy with none of the fine control available under iPhone OS 3.</p>



<p>With any luck it won&#8217;t be too long until iPhone 4 is brought to Australia and I can retire my ageing iPhone 3G.</p>

At a match time of 10 hours, it&#8217;s already <em>three and a half hours</em> longer than the second longest tennis match ever played.</p>



<p>And it&#8217;s not over yet. Play was unfortunately suspended due to poor light early this morning and will resume on day 4 of competition tonight.</p>
