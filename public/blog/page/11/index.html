  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://jimsbooksale.heroku.com/"><img src="/assets/tumblr/tumblr_l7sr4i74kY1qzwfbio1_500.png"/></a></p><p>Last week I sold what I could of my music CDs and gave the rest away. I must have spent almost every dollar I earnt as a teenager on those CDs. In the end I got back about 1/24th of what I originally paid retail. Dying media, eh?</p>



<p>Anyway, I&#8217;ve recently been reading Our Choice by Al Gore, a big heavy book in an almost square shape with textbook-like thick paper and a soft cover. This thing is frustratingly difficult to read and has prompted me to buy a Kindle. To finance the purchase I&#8217;m getting rid of the few books I&#8217;ve acquired over the years that I know I&#8217;ll never read again or that I can buy again as Kindle books, i.e. all of them.</p>



<p>To help my get rid of them I&#8217;ve made a website: <a href="http://jimsbooksale.heroku.com/">jimsbooksale.heroku.com</a> It&#8217;s a Sinatra app with DataMapper interfacing a PostGre database running on <a href="http://heroku.com/">Heroku</a>. The whole thing took about 10 hours from start to finish and I&#8217;m once again blown away by how easy and what a joy it is to make things with this stack.</p>



<p>Unless you live in the inner Brisbane suburbs and can pick it up it&#8217;s probably not worth your while requesting anything but if you want a number of books let me know and I can organise shipping.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>There are basically two supermarket options in Australia: Woolworths and Coles. In every suburb they&#8217;re within walking distance of each other so the decision of which to shop at usually falls to what you grew up with. Usually you&#8217;re a Coles person or a Woolworths person and the other just feels weird.</p>



<p>I grew up shopping at Woolworths and couldn&#8217;t imagine shopping at Coles. Until I did and really liked it for a number of reasons. The latest place I&#8217;m living sits exactly half way between a Woolworths and a Coles. For a couple of months I&#8217;ve been alternating between the two. These are my findings:</p>



<ul><li>Banks charge ridiculous fees for EFTPOS transactions. One way around it is to get a debit card and make EFTPOS transactions as though it&#8217;s a credit card. The money still comes out of your savings or checking account but the fee is moved from you to the retailer. Woolworths obviously weren&#8217;t happy about being charged a few cents every $100+ transaction so they stopped people doing it a few months ago. Coles still allows it just as almost every other store does. +1 Coles.</li>

<li>Woolworths have installed self service checkouts and dramatically reduced checkout staff numbers. The self service checkouts are a huge pain in the ass to use for anything but one or two items. Even at quiet times checking out at Woolworths involves standing in a long line. Coles are the opposite, they have no self service checkouts and lots of staff with usually no waiting in line at all. +1 Coles.</li>

<li>Coles has dedicated bicycle parking, Woolworths does not. +1 Coles.</li>

<li>The plastic produce bags at Coles are thick and never break. Woolworths are thin and often tear when removing them from the spindle or putting bananas in at the wrong angle. It&#8217;s small but it makes a difference. +1 Coles.</li>

<li>Coles have a special kind of small trolley that&#8217;s much bigger than a basket but smaller and raised higher than a regular trolley. For someone like me shopping for one it&#8217;s perfect, everything fits easily and I don&#8217;t need to bend all way over to fill and empty it. Woolworths just have small baskets and huge trollies. +1 Coles.</li>

<li>Woolworths have a rewards program and card. I realise that this is a blatant lock-in trap and that I&#8217;ll probably have to spend $10,000 before I get any kind of reward back but I have to buy food so I figure I may as well be accumulating <em>something</em>. Coles also have a program but it&#8217;s tied to a frequent flyer program for which I&#8217;ll rarely reap the benefits. +1 Woolworths.</li>

<li>Woolworths has spent money on creating a nice ambiance, the lighting is good, displays not too crass and the aisles are wide. Coles haven&#8217;t put the same work into ambiance. +1 Woolworths.</li>

<li>I can get everything I like at Woolworths, Coles is missing a number of things that I like. +1 Woolworths.</li>

</ul><p>The things Woolworths does at the expense of my time and money does not result in cheaper prices. I can barely tell the difference between the two in price. Coles is the clear winner but with its range issue for things I like it means I either need to make an additional trip to Woolworths each week or start eating differently.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote>And you&#8217;re seeing things like in the Melbourne bike hire scheme - it&#8217;s not working as well as it has in the rest of the world because people don&#8217;t walk around with a helmet just in case. You&#8217;ve got helmets creating a barrier to cycling, particularly spontaneous, short-trip cycling.</blockquote><p>Associate Professor Chris Rissel <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/08/16/2983587.htm">appealing for helmet laws to be scrapped</a>.</p>



<p>As someone who commutes exclusively by bike, trains and races a bike and has been <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/141205452">hit by a car</a> while riding a bike, I couldn&#8217;t agree more. Compulsory helmet laws are counter productive to cyclist safety.</p>



<p>The more cyclists on the road the more safe cycling infrastructure, the less motorists on the road, the more awareness of cyclists from motorists. The support for helmet laws seems to be from people who personally think cycling is very dangerous and wouldn&#8217;t go helmet-less themselves. A commenter on the article:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>I would not venture out on a bike without a helmet, given these road conditions. Australia needs a shift in attitude both towards the car and the bike before we can shed our helmet laws.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Repealing compulsory helmet laws <em>is</em> the shift in attitude Australia needs. The beauty of repealing the law is that if you want to wear a helmet, you can! I would certainly still wear a helmet during training rides and races but wouldn&#8217;t bother for the low speed, low traffic, extremely safe 1km ride to the shops or to a friend&#8217;s house.</p>



<p>The overwhelming evidence that no compulsory helmet laws dramatically encourage cycling and therefore make it safer is plain to see in countries like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-AbPav5E5M&amp;hd=1">the Netherlands</a> and Denmark.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m now half way through <a href="http://www.bignerdranch.com/book/cocoa%C2%AE_programming_for_mac%C2%AE_os_x_3rd_edition">Cocoa Programming for Mac OS X</a> and I&#8217;m still seriously struggling to get my head around things. So much in Cocoa seems to  happen by magic. Take this paragraph:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>You may now be saying, &#8220;Chapter 3 said that the designated initializer does all the work and calls the superclass&#8217;s designated initializer. It said that all other initializers call the designated initializer. But Person has an init method, which is its designated initializer, and this new initializer doesn&#8217;t call it.&#8221; You are right: initWithCoder: is an exception to initializer rules.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Now I had to re-read this about 5 times before I understood what it was saying but that aside, initWithCoder just happens to be an exception to initializer rules. Aaron Hillegass has pointed it out in this case but it feels like &#8220;this just does that, alright?&#8221; is the only explanation for too many things.</p>



<p>That coupled with the abstraction that happens in Interface Builder which is hidden once you return to Xcode makes it difficult for me to get my head around why things are happening or not happening.</p>



<p>Every new chapter I finish I&#8217;m further convinced I should just stick to web development. Hopefully a moment of clarity will come as I start messing around myself and try a range of learning materials.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.farbeyondthestars.com/57-things/">The Less You Have, The More Epic Your Life</a></p><p>Everett Bogue owns just 57 things. After reading the list you might wonder how he brushes his teeth, washes himself or his clothes, cooks food, cleans his accommodation, where he sits, what he sleeps on, how he keeps food frozen, what he eats from or with or how he pumps up his bike tyres.</p>



<p>The answer to a lot of those questions seems to be he lives with someone and they obviously have a lot of shared items that facilitate these necessities of life. I&#8217;d say that invalidates the 57 things count but maybe, like the underwear disclaimer, it&#8217;s one of the unspoken rules of the minimalist blogger:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>I’m counting my underwear and socks together because every other minimalist blogger does too. We’re allowed to cheat on undergarments because we always have.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Irrefutable logic.</p>



<p>Pretend for a minute that he really only has 57 things in the way it&#8217;s being sold. As I&#8217;ve <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/160357037">written before</a>, simplicity not minimalism should be the goal. There is no inherent good in minimalism. Owning a toothbrush is not a burden <em>plus</em> it makes it very easy to brush my teeth when the time comes twice a day.</p>



<p>As with many things Bike Snob <a href="http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2010/08/new-smugness-keeping-it-to-minimum.html">sums it up</a> using minimal words:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>[…] at what point is the effort involved ultimately less simple than simply having the stuff?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/compare/pc-vs-mac.aspx">Mac vs. PC by Microsoft</a></p><p>Observations:</p>



<ul><li>The centrepiece of the page is stock photography.</li>

<li>&#8220;Working hard&#8221; is one of their selling points.</li>

<li>&#8220;Macs can take time to learn&#8221;.</li>

<li>Three of the six areas mention Office incompatibilities, software Microsoft also releases for the Mac.</li>

<li>Lots of &#8220;mays&#8221; and &#8220;mights&#8221;. Nothing substantiated, just planting seeds of doubt.</li>

</ul><p>The difference in each campaign embodies the difference in each company on the whole. Apple sell the Mac&#8217;s advantages, Microsoft sell the Mac&#8217;s potential disadvantages. Offence vs. defence.</p>



<p>Beside that, the whole thing is just full of inaccuracies or exaggerations designed to scare:</p>



<ul><li>&#8220;And Macs can&#8217;t connect to an Xbox 360&#8221;. I connect to my Xbox from my iMac almost daily.</li>

<li>&#8221;[&#8230;] the mouse works differently&#8221;. Not true.</li>

<li>&#8220;With a Mac, it&#8217;s harder to set up secure sharing for your photos, music &amp; movies, documents, and even printers with other computers on your home network.&#8221; Not true.</li>

<li>&#8220;On a Mac, you have to manually set up photo sharing, manually set up music and movie sharing, manually set up file sharing, and manually set up printer sharing.&#8221; That&#8217;s true, each involves clicking a check box.</li>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>A week in the life of many I see every Saturday morning:</p>



<ol><li>Always take the lift instead of the stairs.</li>

<li>Treat escalators like rides.</li>

<li>Watch 3 hours of TV each evening.</li>

<li>Drive <em>everywhere</em>, even the shortest of distances.</li>

<li>Join a group of 10 others on Saturday morning to attend a $20, 1 hour bootcamp involving relentless, unpleasant physical activity while being yelled at by a personal trainer.</li>

<li>Suffer an injury.</li>

<li>Sore all over, spend the next five days doing nothing while you recover.</li>

<li>Associate exercise with terrible things, resent it.</li>

</ol><p>Exercise needs to be a part of life. It doesn&#8217;t work as a chore you do to top up your fitness every couple of weeks. When it is treated that way with things like boot camps the negatives it produces in the form of injuries, exhaustion for days and negative connotations with exercise totally outweigh any benefit from a one hour workout.</p>



<p>Keeping fit and healthy is simple: find a physical activity you love. For me it&#8217;s cycling, for you it could be tennis, swimming, rowing, boxing, skipping, dancing or walking though the park. The physical benefits become a side effect of something you love doing in any case.</p>

<p>This is the way I feel about all holidays. One recurring memory from my childhood is my Mum working her butt off (and getting appropriately stressed) to have everything organised in time for us to take a holiday.</p>



<p>In my year and a half of working full time I&#8217;ve taken very little leave and almost none in big blocks. Yet I&#8217;ve never felt overworked, stressed or like I need to take a holiday. I work sane hours and lead a rich life outside of work. Everyone is doing it wrong.</p>

<p>For me it was make up sex followed by an empty feeling a couple of days after I&#8217;d realised what I&#8217;d done. Nonetheless, a bad breakup doesn&#8217;t nullify 6 years of good times.</p>

<blockquote><p>Today’s overdue Mac Pro update is a welcome change, but for a computer that’s so expensive, why not just get an iMac?</p></blockquote>



<p>This is exactly the question I faced when upgrading to my current computer, a low specced 27&#8221; iMac. Three things weighed most heavily into my decision:</p>



<ul><li>A lowest end Mac Pro plus a cinema display is <em>way more</em> expensive than a lowest end iMac. The higher the specs on each model the lower the margin but I have no need for extreme performance.</li>

<li>Six months ago you couldn&#8217;t buy a 27&#8221; LED display outside of an iMac.</li>

<li>Unlike previous generation iMacs and thanks to the wonders of DisplayPort I can use use the iMac&#8217;s display as an external display for a Mac Pro in the future.</li>

</ul><p>So come 6 or 12 months when my low specced iMac starts to feel unbearably slow I&#8217;ll buy a Mac Pro and reap the benefits Marco lists while keeping the most valuable part of the iMac. There&#8217;ll be a computer sitting on the back of the iMac not doing anything but that&#8217;s a small write off.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>To summarise, Gillard is proposing <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/07/25/2963409.htm">pulling money from 100% emission-free solar power schemes</a> to encourage people&#8217;s replacement of their heavy emission producing cars for slightly less heavy emission producing cars, a dependance on which causes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_the_automobile_on_societies">a number of emission-unrelated problems</a>.</p>



<p>Car manufactures will be doing backflips and punters will be stoked they can buy an expensive car even further out of their means.</p>



<p>A good time to remind my Australian readers that <a href="http://greens.org.au/">the Greens</a> are the only responsible way to vote in the upcoming election. They are not a one policy party, they have detailed, well organised and presented policies in all key areas <a href="http://greens.org.au/policies">published on their website</a>.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>So <a href="http://blogs.consumerreports.org/electronics/2010/07/apple-iphone-4-antenna-issue-iphone4-problems-dropped-calls-lab-test-confirmed-problem-issues-signal-strength-att-network-gsm.html">Consumer Reports can&#8217;t recommend the iPhone 4</a>.</p>



<p>And the iPhone 4 is <a href="http://digitaldaily.allthingsd.com/20100712/consumer-reports-by-the-way-the-iphone-4-is-also-the-best-smartphone-on-the-market/">Consumer Reports highest rated smart phone</a>.</p>



<p>I am as excited about getting Consumer Reports highest rated phone today as I was the day it was released. Why?</p>



<ol><li>On the whole, reception is <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/07/13/yes-the-iphone-4-is-broken-no-the-iphone-4-is-not-broken/">way better than previous iPhones</a>. Many are reporting if they try really hard they can reproduce the problem but in real world use they&#8217;re dropping <em>far fewer calls</em> with the iPhone 4 (I should stop right here, it&#8217;s all that matters).</li>

<li>The &#8220;problem&#8221; is 100% solved with a case or <a href="http://www.marco.org/733115343">small piece of tape</a> (and that&#8217;s probably a much bigger piece than what&#8217;s actually required).</li>

<li>It&#8217;s Consumer Reports <em>highest rated phone</em>. Higher even than Consumer Reports second highest rated phone, the iPhone 3GS, a phone with no reception issue hysteria.</li>

</ol><p>Then there&#8217;s the flakey proximity sensor issue the likes of which <a href="http://log.maniacalrage.net/post/763449236/update-on-iphone-4-issues-part-ii">Garrett Murray is experiencing</a>.</p>



<p>What a fantastic reason to use the hands free headphones and not hold a microwave transmitter next to your brain. Even if the <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2010/05/17/2901641.htm">link isn&#8217;t clear</a> it&#8217;s not worth the risk.</p>



<p>The only thing that frustrates me about these issues is that it&#8217;s obviously delaying the iPhone 4&#8217;s release in Australia.</p>



<p>It&#8217;ll be interesting to see what Apple announces at its <a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2010/07/14/apple-to-hold-special-iphone-4-press-conference-on-friday/">Friday press conference</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><img src="/assets/tumblr/tumblr_l5cbra3ndO1qzwfbio1_500.jpg"/><br/><p>Today I saw the <a href="http://qag.qld.gov.au/exhibitions/current/ron_mueck">Ron Mueck exhibition at the Queensland GoMA</a>. Months after the exhibition opened it was still crowded and rightfully so, the pieces are surreal.</p>



<p>It didn&#8217;t even occur to me to take a camera but it seemed the huge majority of patrons were taking photos. Flash photography wasn&#8217;t allowed but many were using flashes anyway (I think most people have no idea  how to turn their flash off nor want to know how). People were moving to a piece, taking a number of photos from different angles, moving to the next and shooting again. There were more camera phones than point and shoots and there were no SLRs.</p>



<p>There are <a href="http://www.google.com.au/images?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=ron%20mueck&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;redir_esc=&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;hl=en&amp;tab=wi">many photos of Ron Mueck&#8217;s work online</a>.</p>



<p>I genuinely want to know what&#8217;s going through people&#8217;s minds when each individual from a group of three is documenting the exhibit with their own terrible phone camera. For what reason are they doing it? To go back and reminisce about that time they went to the art gallery and took photographs? To prove to others that they went? To enjoy the art all over again to make up for what they missed while they were <em>actually there</em>?</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t get it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote>iPhone 3G horribly slow after the iOS 4 update? Back up and restore. Totally fixed mine.</blockquote>I can confirm this information from <a href="http://twitter.com/waxpancake/status/18065397473">Andy Baio</a>. The speed isn&#8217;t earth shattering, as it wasn&#8217;t on 3.x, but it&#8217;s definitely back to pre-iOS 4 levels. I&#8217;d been really resenting the iOS 4 update and had been dying for the iPhone 4 to be released in Australia up until now.

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://asolidbase.net/"><img src="/assets/tumblr/tumblr_l58lujka7k1qzwfbio1_500.png"/></a></p><p>This is the redesign I was working towards when I first started <a href="http://asolidbase.net/">A Solid Base</a> at the start of the year. I&#8217;ve been steadily posting and meticulously tagging to a point where I have enough content to add some useful navigation. I particularly like the navigation by colour.</p>



<p>It wasn&#8217;t until I was about 4 hours in that I realised how similar it is to the <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/">Valhalla Island</a> design structurally. I think the 500 pixel wide limit on photo post images in Tumblr somewhat dictates things.</p>



<p>A real domain now too, <a href="http://asolidbase.net/">asolidbase.net</a>!</p>
