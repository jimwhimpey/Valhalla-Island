  <div class="entry-content"><p>For every Facebook photoset showing off 21st birthday parties full of people who shared the same primary school 10 years earlier but haven&#8217;t had much to do with each other since or a hired out community hall elaborately decorated but not full of many people at all, I feel further vindicated by my decision to skip having my own 21st birthday party all together.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t like birthday parties to begin with. I&#8217;d rather celebrate real achievements or celebrate for no reason at all than congratulate myself for staying alive while time has passed. Birthday parties feel like organised attention seeking and make me feel like I&#8217;m cheating. Twenty firsts are everything I hate about birthday parties multiplied.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m frustrated by inconsistent tag input standards. There&#8217;s two kinds:</p>



<p><code>tag, tag one, another, a third tag</code></p>



<p><code>tag "tag one" another "a third tag"</code></p>



<p>The majority of applications use the former and it&#8217;s the best format. It never forces you to consider the amount of words in a tag and the comma is a natural separator.</p>



<p><a href="http://delicious.com/">Delicious</a> uses the latter, an application for which tagging is extremely useful and whose experience most benefits by reduced data input friction.</p>



<p>Spaces are quick when entering single word tags but don&#8217;t work as a logical separator, it feels like I&#8217;m writing a sentence rather than a series of individual keywords. It&#8217;s most annoying when entering multi word tags having to think about and account for multiple word tags before input. It stifles the spew of tags that come to mind when you&#8217;re quickly record and move on.</p>



<p>The problem is exacerbated when almost everything else does it differently making it difficult to even get used to the inferior system.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s decide on one method (the first) and make it the standard.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>The massive majority of things Apple make have appeal that branches across all kinds of people and use. Advertising agencies, software developers and Mums use iMacs. Business people, tradesmen and high school kids use iPhones. Same goes for MacBooks, Apple TVs, iPods, Airports, Mac Minis, et cetera, et cetera.</p>



<p>A tablet computer has limited appeal. Who, apart from illustrators, illustrators who use a computer, is a tablet useful to?</p>



<p>Apple isn&#8217;t in the business of making products useful only to one specific niche. People in specific niches do use Apple computers but it&#8217;s because they&#8217;re flexible, not because they were made for them.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t expect Apple to make a tablet computer the same way I don&#8217;t expect them to make a point of sale system, air traffic control panel or poker machine.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Daniel Jalkut of <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/">Red Sweater Software</a> in <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/">response to</a> Cabel Sasser of <a href="http://www.panic.com/">Panic</a>&#8217;s post on their <a href="http://www.cabel.name/2009/05/so-many-things.html">expansion to 13 staff</a> from two man beginnings:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>It struck me while reading Cabel’s post, for instance, that Panic apparently has no marketing staff. And yet they’re one of the best known brands in indie Mac software. Paradox? Is there something about Panic’s product and staff that <em>does its own marketing?</em> Or would they be an even bigger success had they hired a marketing person from the start? <a href="http://www.smileonmymac.com/">Smile On My Mac</a>, by contrast, consists of just three people, one of whom is completely dedicated to marketing. Is this a waste of revenue or a brilliant component of their plan for world <a href="http://www.smileonmymac.com/TextExpander/">text expansion</a> domination?</p>

</blockquote>



<p>I&#8217;m a believer in the maxim: make a great product and the marketing will take care of itself. A fantastic press release, email newsletter or advertising campaign, no matter how brilliant, can&#8217;t make a mediocre application popular.</p>



<p>Everyone who&#8217;s ever worked at Panic has taken care of the marketing indirectly by building something great and genuinely useful.</p>



<p>Hiring a marketing person is pre-internet thinking. It made sense when making someone not in your immediate geographical area aware your product existed was a serious hurdle. Now everyone has global reach at their fingertips and word of mouth is literally multiplied by the million.</p>



<p>Is it a paradox that Panic, with their 13 staff, none of which are marketing, have a website that feels more down to earth, friendly and useful despite Smile on my Mac&#8217;s much smaller team of 3 that includes one fully dedicated to marketing?</p>

<p>The one thing it&#8217;s missing is price. I understand that prices differ all over the world and Trek have an obligation to send you to their suppliers but even a USD RRP would complete the online window shopping experience.</p>

<p>Last night we were fortunate to see this beautiful song performed by The Middle East. Unfortunately it was the only song we saw. I&#8217;d never heard of them, the name put me off and the support often sucks. I couldn&#8217;t have been more wrong this time. This is exactly the kind of nuanced, <em>thick</em> music I love. I should&#8217;ve known Okkervil River would choose their support carefully.</p>



<p>Apologies for the audio quality, it&#8217;s <a href="http://rogueamoeba.com/audiohijackpro/">hijacked</a> from their <a href="http://www.myspace.com/visitthemiddleeast">MySpace</a> (the band&#8217;s only website). While I mostly missed them this time I&#8217;ll catch them again when they play in June as part of a big East Coast of Australia tour. See them if you can.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s regurgitation, nothing more. I understand the noble desire to attribute but copying someone else&#8217;s post verbatim is less attribution, more mindless duplication.</p>



<p>If you like something someone&#8217;s said, give it a star, it&#8217;s built right into Twitter. If you like it more than a single star can express and you just <em>have</em> to share it with the world, link to it, it&#8217;s built right into the internet. Link to it and say why, add something of your own, add something <em>original</em>.</p>



<p>I make an effort to not follow people who retweet, those who don&#8217;t must have streams filled with constant repetition of not only the same information but the <em>exact same words</em>. It&#8217;s got to feel like a mail client that delivers every email five times over.</p>



<p>Reblogging in Tumblr is great for linking posts that respond or add on each other. I use it often when quoting a passage from a post or linking to the same thing someone else has. I always add my own thought, it&#8217;s the only reason I&#8217;m reblogging at all, without it, reblogging is duplication, just redundant data in a database.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s abused. Popular posts have a string of nested &#8220;quotes&#8221; that contain nothing more than the name of another copycat.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote>They might as well name it “Windows 7: We Hold You in Contempt and Dare You, Fucking Dare You, to Try Something Else Edition</blockquote><p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/04/21/windows-7-starter">John Gruber</a> in response to the news Windows 7 Starter Edition only allows <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/Bott/?p=844">3 applications to run at any one time</a>.</p>



<p>This is mind-blowingly stupid. I was going to say &#8220;it&#8217;s like Microsoft is going out of it&#8217;s way to frustrate and annoy users&#8221; but it&#8217;s not like anything, Microsoft <em>actually is</em> going out of it&#8217;s way to frustrate and annoy users.</p>



<p>The only possible justification for such a ridiculous limitation is &#8220;incentive&#8221; to &#8220;upgrade&#8221; to a more expensive &#8220;fully featured&#8221; edition of Windows 7. After experiencing total frustration and being effectively bribed by a crippled OS, is forking out more money for a different version of <em>the same OS</em> something anyone is going to feel good about?</p>



<p>Every Windows user I know has the it&#8217;s not that bad, I can live with it mindset. But with each new version it&#8217;s getting <em>that</em> bad and when you can&#8217;t listen to music while downloading a movie, reading RSS feeds and running IM <em>living with it</em> starts to really suck. How bad does it have to get before people will switch to fully featured, cheaper (even free!) alternatives? It can&#8217;t be long</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>When my local pool changed ownership they ditched time based memberships for entry based. Previously you could buy one, three, six or twelve month membership that allowed you unlimited entry to the pool. The new system sells 20 and 40 entry passes and no other kind of membership. (Drop in entries remain in both systems).</p>



<p>The membership model made you feel like part of something, the pool was yours, literally at your unlimited disposal. It encouraged regular sessions at the pool as you wanted to get your money&#8217;s worth each month. Pay for a month&#8217;s membership, only visit the pool twice and you&#8217;ve wasted your money.</p>



<p>The entry model makes you feel as good as the number of entries left on your card. Each visit brings you closer to the day you have to pay again. It discourages visits while you question whether it&#8217;s really worth using your quota on a day you don&#8217;t feel 100% or the weather is a little cooler.</p>



<p>At a place like a pool where the water has to be kept clean, the front desk attended, the grounds tidy and the lifeguards on duty whether there&#8217;s people swimming or not, the entry model doesn&#8217;t make sense for the business or swimmers.</p>
