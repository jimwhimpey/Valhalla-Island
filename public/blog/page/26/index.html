  <div class="entry-content"><p>I understand the desire to shower in the morning. It&#8217;s a nice, fresh way to wake yourself and start the day. I don&#8217;t understand <em>only</em> showering in the morning.</p>



<p>The day is when you get dirty. Bringing that dirt to bed then washing it off in the morning, just in time to get dirty again doesn&#8217;t make sense. The bed is clean, if you want to be clean the next day showering only at night is works because you don&#8217;t get dirty while you sleep.</p>



<p>If you hold water preservation goals and limit yourself to a single shower per day, the evening option has to be the way to go. Sleep clean, start the day clean.</p>

<p>This clip sums up what I love most about Comedy and Everything Else. They&#8217;re not afraid to go to the extremes of silly or the extremes of seriousness. They get angry, they relaxed, they go slow and go fast.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m sure you know people who flat out refuse to talk about anything even remotely serious, those people who treat anything outside the tiny bubble of their immediate environment or day to day life not their problem and shoot down attempts to bring it up. Just as you know people who frown on the silly, who stare down a joke and refuse to make light of a situation. Often it&#8217;s the same person, the same person left with a bland middle ground of no opinion, personality or fun.</p>



<p>Comedy and Everything Else do what they feel. Playing radio with funny drop ins isn&#8217;t too silly and condemning torture isn&#8217;t too serious. The silly parts are hilarious, the serious is thought-provoking.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s crazy to <em>still</em> be talking about IE6 but the reality of the problems it causes remain.</p>



<p>The idea that a website has to look <em>identical</em> in every browser, even at the expense of design in browsers that render a page correctly, is insane. No one but the developer looks at the same website in multiple browsers, if it looks different between them, no one knows (let alone cares).</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve always said that the <em>content</em>, the reason the user is at the website in the first place will always be available in IE6 whether it&#8217;s with display perfection, CSS bugs or no CSS at all. It&#8217;s not worth hours hacking your way to perfect cross-browser consistency in a browser that is fundamentally flawed when no IE6 user knows what it&#8217;s supposed to look like anyway.</p>



<p>With anything under my control the philosophy is to completely ignore IE6. I spend my time developing better websites for browsers that work and worst case scenario (the most common scenario) it doesn&#8217;t <em>look</em> &#8220;right&#8221; in IE6, big fucking deal.</p>



<p>The universal IE6 stylesheet is doing a little more than nothing and I think, gets the balance right.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote>I’m a guy who doesn’t see anything good having come from the Internet. Period. [the Internet has] created this notion that anyone can have whatever they want at any given time. It’s as if the stores on Madison Avenue were open 24 hours a day. They feel entitled. They say, ‘Give it to me now,’ and if you don’t give it to them for free, they’ll steal it.</blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwd.com/media-news/fashion-memopad/memo-pad-uniqlo-nabs-deyn-bad-internet-classic-martha-2136751?src=rss/recentstories/20090515#/article/media-news/fashion-memopad/memo-pad-uniqlo-nabs-deyn-bad-internet-classic-martha-2136751?page=2">Michael Lynton, CEO Sony Pictures Entertainment</a></p>



<p>This is an incredible quote and exactly the reason these companies are failing. Not only do they not <em>get</em> the internet, they&#8217;re hostile towards it. They&#8217;re so blinded by their view of the internet as an avenue for illegal activity at their company&#8217;s expense that they fail to see <em>any</em> good or opportunity at all.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s despite iTunes, an <em>internet-only</em> music retailer, hitting <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2008/04/03itunes.html">the number 1 spot for music retailers in the US</a> (internet or otherwise) now with completely DRM-free tracks. There&#8217;s a million reasons why iTunes is better than piracy, it&#8217;s more reliable, faster, better quality, more easily searchable, the meta data is complete and correct, etc. Not to mention that it&#8217;s the legal and <em>moral</em> option. <a href="http://www.marco.org/109607811">As Marco says</a>, do better than the pirates and people are happy to pay.</p>

<p>The money band is the simplicity and low profile of a money clip without the pretension.

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://achoiceinthematter.tumblr.com/">1001 things I want in a lover</a> is a tumblog that often features on Tumblr&#8217;s <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/popular">popular posts list</a>. Here&#8217;s a few typical post examples:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Someone who has my schedule memorized with the purpose of surprising me.</p>

  

  <p>Someone who thinks everything I do is adorable.</p>

  

  <p>Someone who thinks that I’m the best thing that ever happened.</p>

  

  <p>Someone who will always have my favorite cereal at their house every time I come over.</p>

  

  <p>Someone who teaches me something new everyday.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>I can&#8217;t stand this bullshit. You don&#8217;t want a lover, you want a butler. No person leading their own life does half this shit. No one is going to spend their life dedicated to indulging your every whim and doting on your every insecurity. And if they did, I guarantee you&#8217;d get bored of it quickly.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For every Facebook photoset showing off 21st birthday parties full of people who shared the same primary school 10 years earlier but haven&#8217;t had much to do with each other since or a hired out community hall elaborately decorated but not full of many people at all, I feel further vindicated by my decision to skip having my own 21st birthday party all together.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t like birthday parties to begin with. I&#8217;d rather celebrate real achievements or celebrate for no reason at all than congratulate myself for staying alive while time has passed. Birthday parties feel like organised attention seeking and make me feel like I&#8217;m cheating. Twenty firsts are everything I hate about birthday parties multiplied.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m frustrated by inconsistent tag input standards. There&#8217;s two kinds:</p>



<p><code>tag, tag one, another, a third tag</code></p>



<p><code>tag "tag one" another "a third tag"</code></p>



<p>The majority of applications use the former and it&#8217;s the best format. It never forces you to consider the amount of words in a tag and the comma is a natural separator.</p>



<p><a href="http://delicious.com/">Delicious</a> uses the latter, an application for which tagging is extremely useful and whose experience most benefits by reduced data input friction.</p>



<p>Spaces are quick when entering single word tags but don&#8217;t work as a logical separator, it feels like I&#8217;m writing a sentence rather than a series of individual keywords. It&#8217;s most annoying when entering multi word tags having to think about and account for multiple word tags before input. It stifles the spew of tags that come to mind when you&#8217;re quickly record and move on.</p>



<p>The problem is exacerbated when almost everything else does it differently making it difficult to even get used to the inferior system.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s decide on one method (the first) and make it the standard.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>The massive majority of things Apple make have appeal that branches across all kinds of people and use. Advertising agencies, software developers and Mums use iMacs. Business people, tradesmen and high school kids use iPhones. Same goes for MacBooks, Apple TVs, iPods, Airports, Mac Minis, et cetera, et cetera.</p>



<p>A tablet computer has limited appeal. Who, apart from illustrators, illustrators who use a computer, is a tablet useful to?</p>



<p>Apple isn&#8217;t in the business of making products useful only to one specific niche. People in specific niches do use Apple computers but it&#8217;s because they&#8217;re flexible, not because they were made for them.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t expect Apple to make a tablet computer the same way I don&#8217;t expect them to make a point of sale system, air traffic control panel or poker machine.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Daniel Jalkut of <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/">Red Sweater Software</a> in <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/">response to</a> Cabel Sasser of <a href="http://www.panic.com/">Panic</a>&#8217;s post on their <a href="http://www.cabel.name/2009/05/so-many-things.html">expansion to 13 staff</a> from two man beginnings:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>It struck me while reading Cabel’s post, for instance, that Panic apparently has no marketing staff. And yet they’re one of the best known brands in indie Mac software. Paradox? Is there something about Panic’s product and staff that <em>does its own marketing?</em> Or would they be an even bigger success had they hired a marketing person from the start? <a href="http://www.smileonmymac.com/">Smile On My Mac</a>, by contrast, consists of just three people, one of whom is completely dedicated to marketing. Is this a waste of revenue or a brilliant component of their plan for world <a href="http://www.smileonmymac.com/TextExpander/">text expansion</a> domination?</p>

</blockquote>



<p>I&#8217;m a believer in the maxim: make a great product and the marketing will take care of itself. A fantastic press release, email newsletter or advertising campaign, no matter how brilliant, can&#8217;t make a mediocre application popular.</p>



<p>Everyone who&#8217;s ever worked at Panic has taken care of the marketing indirectly by building something great and genuinely useful.</p>



<p>Hiring a marketing person is pre-internet thinking. It made sense when making someone not in your immediate geographical area aware your product existed was a serious hurdle. Now everyone has global reach at their fingertips and word of mouth is literally multiplied by the million.</p>



<p>Is it a paradox that Panic, with their 13 staff, none of which are marketing, have a website that feels more down to earth, friendly and useful despite Smile on my Mac&#8217;s much smaller team of 3 that includes one fully dedicated to marketing?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://trekbikes.com"><img src="/assets/tumblr/oaQecruTZmgzzbft4CIheSVgo1_500.png"/></a></p><p>For someone obsessed with looking at bikes online <a href="http://trekbikes.com">Trek&#8217;s website</a> satisfies where almost every other bike manufacturer website fails. It&#8217;s perfectly organised, easy to navigate, functional and most importantly, provides great photos in super high resolutions.</p>



<p>The one thing it&#8217;s missing is price. I understand that prices differ all over the world and Trek have an obligation to send you to their suppliers but even a USD RRP would complete the online window shopping experience.</p>
