  <div class="entry-content"><p>On first use a lot bothers me about Tweetie for Mac. No title in the title bar, awkward looking breadcrumbs, âŒ˜R bound to replies rather than refresh, pointless iPhone style scroll bar, forced combination of both menu bar <em>and</em> dock icons held together with mountains of superfluous animation. It&#8217;s the freak offspring of a Mac and iPhone app.</p>



<p>Yet it somehow comes together to make a pleasant overall package. I&#8217;m switching from <a href="http://thecosmicmachine.com/">EventBox</a> for a few days while I try it out properly.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I hate this vigilante journalism, the-media-is-lying-to-you bullshit from people with a copy of Flash, a microphone and a week alone in their bedroom.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s his premise without the lame jokes and superfluous animation:</p>



<ol><li>Somali pirates hijack ships at gunpoint, receive a ransom and leave.</li>

<li>The media reports this.</li>

<li>Foreigners ditch nuclear waste <em>and</em> overfish Somalia&#8217;s waters.</li>

<li>The media doesn&#8217;t mention this when reporting on pirate attacks.</li>

<li>So who&#8217;s the <em>real</em> bad guys?!</li>

</ol><p>Yeah, committing a crime against an innocent company and group of people is justified when a totally unrelated group of people pollute and overfish your waters. According to this guy, it&#8217;s not only justified but the pirates are the <em>good guys</em>.</p>



<p>Then the <em>terrible</em> media only reports the pirate attacks without going in depth on every story relating to Somalia and the whole continent it belongs to.</p>



<p>The mainstream media sucks in a lot of ways, this isn&#8217;t one of them.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am totally for maternity leave.</p>



<p>I am totally against <em>paid</em> maternity leave.</p>



<p>Consider this scenario: My Mum&#8217;s small business has one full time employee and no one else. If her employee got pregnant and took 6 months maternity leave while Mum had to, by law, pay her full (or even half) wage, the business would literally go bankrupt.</p>



<p>The other option is government funded paid maternity leave. It wouldn&#8217;t send small business bankrupt but it means the tax payer foots the bill for a working woman&#8217;s decision to get pregnant.</p>



<p>Besides that, why should anyone be paid while not doing anything? Accrued leave is different, you&#8217;ve worked to earn it.</p>



<p>That said, I couldn&#8217;t be more for unpaid maternity leave. I definitely think mothers need time to spend with their new born babies and they should take as much as they like with the promise of their job waiting for them when they&#8217;re ready to return.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few of my friends are the drink-at-every-opportunity, go-out-four-nights-a-week, spend-all-your-disposable-income-on-alcohol-and-related-activities type. I used to be the same but since taking up triathlon five months ago I&#8217;ve cut back to almost nothing. I still hang out with these friends and have a great time with them but when I, again, told a friend I wouldn&#8217;t be drinking tonight he said:</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re wasting your best drinking years!&#8221;</p>



<p>I see it in a totally different light. Some training is spent with guys and girls 40-years plus whose bodies struggle to recover from chronic injuries, if they recover at all. Niggling injuries last forever. They react badly to racing and they generally just <em>hurt</em>. It&#8217;s not the case for me, I&#8217;m young, limbre and recover strongly after racing. I&#8217;m making the best use of my body while it&#8217;s still young enough to perform and recover well.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re looking to rent a two bedroom apartment for around $400/week but our <strong>number one priority</strong> is close location to work. The green areas are all close. Our list of travel options in my order of preference:</p>



<ol><li>Cycling</li>

<li>Walking</li>

<li>Ferry (The City Cat, which <a href="http://www.monocle.com/webprogrammes/Quality-of-Life-Index/CityCat-Brisbane/">Monocle rates highly</a>)</li>

<li>Train with no transfers</li>

</ol><p>If I can&#8217;t commute to work within 15 or 20 minutes each way using those modes of transport the place isn&#8217;t suitable. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve chosen the areas we have. There&#8217;s a huge abundance of dedicated bike paths, train lines and ferry terminals lining the river.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>ABC News:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>A 15-year-old Brisbane boy with Asperger&#8217;s syndrome who went missing for two weeks has been found in Sydney, after riding his bike more than 950 kilometres down the Pacific Highway.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Absolutely incredible. I greatly admire this kid&#8217;s determination, resolve and physical endurance. I&#8217;m also impressed with his parents for acting rationally when they noticed him withdrawing money from his bank account by depositing extra funds so he&#8217;d have enough to pay for food.</p>



<p>The huge distances he covered day after day resemble the type of riding required to race a tour. A cycling team should pick him up.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/"><img src="/assets/tumblr/oaQecruTZm9z84d27NxOB2G7o1_500.png"/></a></p><p>Tomorrow will mark my 5th day at my first full time job. It&#8217;s a web developer position at <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/">ABC News Online</a>. That is the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, a government funded, non-commercial national broadcaster. They have two national TV channels, heaps of local radio stations around the country, produce many of their own news and current affairs programs and run an online news department. They have a reputation for quality and substance that other free-to-air broadcasters in Australia lack.</p>



<p>The news site serves around 600,000 visits per day depending on big news stories and makes up the vast majority of the ABC&#8217;s website traffic. We have a massive amount of constantly fresh and deep archives of content and statistics to work with, it&#8217;s my job to make it accessible and usable on the web.</p>



<p>The setup of the site borders between hacked together and ingenious. I&#8217;m learning a lot about scaling, caching and legacy systems.</p>



<p>Before starting at the ABC I saw corporate web development as an isolated bubble void of innovation, up to date practices, standards support or regard for the web in the real world. My colleagues are better than any freelance or small team developer I&#8217;ve come across. They&#8217;re knowledge is up to the minute, as is their skill and I was surprised to find a high level of flexibility, innovation, openness to ideas and an absence of bureaucracy.</p>



<p>Currently I use a temporary PC at the office which is really slowing me down. I&#8217;ve requested a Mac, another team uses them in Sydney but my hopes aren&#8217;t high. If I don&#8217;t get one ABC issued I&#8217;ll upgrade my PowerBook to a MacBook and use that at work. I can work five times as fast and have more fun doing it in OS X, it&#8217;s worth it when I&#8217;m spending eight hours a day there.</p>



<p>The other issue is my home&#8217;s distance from work. It&#8217;s not <em>huge</em> but it requires a change of trains in the city and that plus walking to the station at both ends adds up to about <strong>four hours a day</strong> travelling on top of the eight hours I&#8217;m already working. It&#8217;s too much. Factor in eating and sleeping and I&#8217;m left with only a couple of hours spare each day.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve wanted to get out of home for a long time so as soon as a few pay cheques come in Kristin and I are going to find a place within walking or cycling distance of the city and our workplaces. My commute time will be cut to 15 enjoyable minutes each way and I&#8217;ll save three and a half hours per day. I&#8217;m looking forward to it but until then I&#8217;ll tough it out.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.marco.org/95613967">Translations from Park Slope real-estate listings to real life</a></p><p>I&#8217;m really enjoying Marco&#8217;s series on looking for an apartment to rent. Despite being on opposite sides of the planet I think we&#8217;re looking for a pretty similar type of place.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re a month off seriously looking for a place but from just a few hours browsing the listings on <a href="http://www.realestate.com.au/">realestate.com.au</a> and <a href="http://www.domain.com.au/">Domain</a> the ridiculous &#8220;sales&#8221; tactics (or complete incompetence) of real estate agents is obvious. The amount of listings with a single photo of the view or the exterior of an apartment building <em>and nothing else</em> is incredible. Then there&#8217;s the listings without any photos at all or with photos so low in resolution and quality it&#8217;s impossible to tell what colour the carpet is or whether the floor&#8217;s carpeted at all.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.marco.org/94597755">Marco Pulls Apart a Microsoft Sponsored Study on the &#8220;Apple Tax&#8221;</a></p><p>I totally agree that Apple stuff is overpriced as far as the high end stuff goes, that is, Macbook Pros and Mac Pros. Although that could just be a hunch because I&#8217;ve never researched a PC with identical or very similar specifications to Apple&#8217;s top of the line computers.</p>



<p>But when it comes to the consumer stuff, Macbooks, iMacs and Mac Minis, the prices are on par. Find a PC with the same specs as a Macbook and it costs about the same. You see really cheap, sub $1000 PC laptops because they&#8217;re simply not as good, Apple don&#8217;t even make a comparable computer so comparing a bottom of the range $600 Dell to a $1600 Macbook on price is unfair.</p>



<p>If Microsoft truly believed there was an Apple Tax on consumer computers then there&#8217;d be no need to rig the study with all the bullshit Marco points out.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A great deal of fawning over notebooks and pens happens on the internet. Curiously it happens most with people more than competent with a computer. Gus Mueller, software developer, <a href="http://gusmueller.com/blog/archives/2009/03/developer_notebooks.html">on notebooks</a>:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>I learned a long time ago that the two best debugging tools I own are a nice piece of paper, and a good pencil.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>I don&#8217;t know whether Gus means this literally but if you&#8217;ve been in an exam that required writing code to answer questions you&#8217;ll know a flattened tree is pretty fucking useless when it comes to debugging. No doubt it&#8217;s great for working through easily visualised problems like trigonometry but the <em>best</em> debugging tool? I disagree.</p>



<p>Like <a href="http://mrgan.tumblr.com/post/91484728/man-without-a-notebook">Neven</a> I don&#8217;t <em>get</em> notebooks. Despite all the UIs I&#8217;ve created, programming problems I&#8217;ve solved and hundreds of words I write a day, I manage without a notebook, it&#8217;s possible.</p>



<p>They&#8217;re impractical, laborious to fill out, the contents completely inflexible once recorded, they&#8217;re impossible to organise, aren&#8217;t searchable, sharable or able to be backed up.</p>



<p>I think it&#8217;s a romantic idea â€” a rugged intellectual in a world where no one reads let alone writes. In lives dominated by computers people like to think the raw materials of a notebook and pen are still the best way, as far as I&#8217;m concerned, it&#8217;s not.</p>
