<p>Last night we were fortunate to see this beautiful song performed by The Middle East. Unfortunately it was the only song we saw. I&#8217;d never heard of them, the name put me off and the support often sucks. I couldn&#8217;t have been more wrong this time. This is exactly the kind of nuanced, <em>thick</em> music I love. I should&#8217;ve known Okkervil River would choose their support carefully.</p>



<p>Apologies for the audio quality, it&#8217;s <a href="http://rogueamoeba.com/audiohijackpro/">hijacked</a> from their <a href="http://www.myspace.com/visitthemiddleeast">MySpace</a> (the band&#8217;s only website). While I mostly missed them this time I&#8217;ll catch them again when they play in June as part of a big East Coast of Australia tour. See them if you can.</p>

I love the way Norris McWhirter, the stadium announcer on the day, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Bannister#The_4-minute_mile">famously drew out</a> the world record announcement:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Ladies and gentlemen, here is the result of event 9, the one-mile: 1st, No. 41, R.G. Bannister, Amateur Athletic Association and formerly of Exeter and Merton Colleges, Oxford, with a time which is a new meeting and track record, and which - subject to ratification - will be a new English Native, British National, All-Comers, European, British Empire, and World Record. The time was 3&#8230;</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a complete shitstorm of icons, labels, toolbars, panels, tabs, menus and sections. 95% of people use 5% of Office&#8217;s features but instead of keeping the stuff you don&#8217;t use out of the way, it&#8217;s in your way and degrades the whole experience.</p>

  <p>Nothing to get too excited about—especially since it&#8217;ll be a while before we all head to Office 2010—but it looks like a decent start.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s regurgitation, nothing more. I understand the noble desire to attribute but copying someone else&#8217;s post verbatim is less attribution, more mindless duplication.</p>



<p>If you like something someone&#8217;s said, give it a star, it&#8217;s built right into Twitter. If you like it more than a single star can express and you just <em>have</em> to share it with the world, link to it, it&#8217;s built right into the internet. Link to it and say why, add something of your own, add something <em>original</em>.</p>



<p>I make an effort to not follow people who retweet, those who don&#8217;t must have streams filled with constant repetition of not only the same information but the <em>exact same words</em>. It&#8217;s got to feel like a mail client that delivers every email five times over.</p>



<p>Reblogging in Tumblr is great for linking posts that respond or add on each other. I use it often when quoting a passage from a post or linking to the same thing someone else has. I always add my own thought, it&#8217;s the only reason I&#8217;m reblogging at all, without it, reblogging is duplication, just redundant data in a database.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s abused. Popular posts have a string of nested &#8220;quotes&#8221; that contain nothing more than the name of another copycat.</p>

It took one final weekend codeathon and we had to scrap features to do it but the 1.0 is out. The best part is now getting onto the fun new features we had to put on hold until the important stuff was done. Look forward to our public API.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m certain it&#8217;s not the developers that made this decision but the managers or sales team or marketing department, it could have been anyone, <em>just not the developers</em>. This has got to be a case of developers tearing their hair out in frustration, arguing against the stupidity of an arbitrary application limit, <em>knowing</em> it&#8217;s wrong, feeling sick while writing the code to make it work but having no stake whatsoever in the decision.</p>

<p>This is mind-blowingly stupid. I was going to say &#8220;it&#8217;s like Microsoft is going out of it&#8217;s way to frustrate and annoy users&#8221; but it&#8217;s not like anything, Microsoft <em>actually is</em> going out of it&#8217;s way to frustrate and annoy users.</p>



<p>The only possible justification for such a ridiculous limitation is &#8220;incentive&#8221; to &#8220;upgrade&#8221; to a more expensive &#8220;fully featured&#8221; edition of Windows 7. After experiencing total frustration and being effectively bribed by a crippled OS, is forking out more money for a different version of <em>the same OS</em> something anyone is going to feel good about?</p>



<p>Every Windows user I know has the it&#8217;s not that bad, I can live with it mindset. But with each new version it&#8217;s getting <em>that</em> bad and when you can&#8217;t listen to music while downloading a movie, reading RSS feeds and running IM <em>living with it</em> starts to really suck. How bad does it have to get before people will switch to fully featured, cheaper (even free!) alternatives? It can&#8217;t be long</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>When my local pool changed ownership they ditched time based memberships for entry based. Previously you could buy one, three, six or twelve month membership that allowed you unlimited entry to the pool. The new system sells 20 and 40 entry passes and no other kind of membership. (Drop in entries remain in both systems).</p>



<p>The membership model made you feel like part of something, the pool was yours, literally at your unlimited disposal. It encouraged regular sessions at the pool as you wanted to get your money&#8217;s worth each month. Pay for a month&#8217;s membership, only visit the pool twice and you&#8217;ve wasted your money.</p>



<p>The entry model makes you feel as good as the number of entries left on your card. Each visit brings you closer to the day you have to pay again. It discourages visits while you question whether it&#8217;s really worth using your quota on a day you don&#8217;t feel 100% or the weather is a little cooler.</p>



<p>At a place like a pool where the water has to be kept clean, the front desk attended, the grounds tidy and the lifeguards on duty whether there&#8217;s people swimming or not, the entry model doesn&#8217;t make sense for the business or swimmers.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I hate this vigilante journalism, the-media-is-lying-to-you bullshit from people with a copy of Flash, a microphone and a week alone in their bedroom.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s his premise without the lame jokes and superfluous animation:</p>



<ol><li>Somali pirates hijack ships at gunpoint, receive a ransom and leave.</li>

<li>The media reports this.</li>

<li>Foreigners ditch nuclear waste <em>and</em> overfish Somalia&#8217;s waters.</li>

<li>The media doesn&#8217;t mention this when reporting on pirate attacks.</li>

<li>So who&#8217;s the <em>real</em> bad guys?!</li>

</ol><p>Yeah, committing a crime against an innocent company and group of people is justified when a totally unrelated group of people pollute and overfish your waters. According to this guy, it&#8217;s not only justified but the pirates are the <em>good guys</em>.</p>



<p>Then the <em>terrible</em> media only reports the pirate attacks without going in depth on every story relating to Somalia and the whole continent it belongs to.</p>



<p>The mainstream media sucks in a lot of ways, this isn&#8217;t one of them.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am totally for maternity leave.</p>



<p>I am totally against <em>paid</em> maternity leave.</p>



<p>Consider this scenario: My Mum&#8217;s small business has one full time employee and no one else. If her employee got pregnant and took 6 months maternity leave while Mum had to, by law, pay her full (or even half) wage, the business would literally go bankrupt.</p>



<p>The other option is government funded paid maternity leave. It wouldn&#8217;t send small business bankrupt but it means the tax payer foots the bill for a working woman&#8217;s decision to get pregnant.</p>



<p>Besides that, why should anyone be paid while not doing anything? Accrued leave is different, you&#8217;ve worked to earn it.</p>



<p>That said, I couldn&#8217;t be more for unpaid maternity leave. I definitely think mothers need time to spend with their new born babies and they should take as much as they like with the promise of their job waiting for them when they&#8217;re ready to return.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re wasting your best drinking years!&#8221;</p>



<p>I see it in a totally different light. Some training is spent with guys and girls 40-years plus whose bodies struggle to recover from chronic injuries, if they recover at all. Niggling injuries last forever. They react badly to racing and they generally just <em>hurt</em>. It&#8217;s not the case for me, I&#8217;m young, limbre and recover strongly after racing. I&#8217;m making the best use of my body while it&#8217;s still young enough to perform and recover well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://static.jimwhimpey.com/images/apartment-map.png"><img src="/assets/tumblr/oaQecruTZmbfwpjykTtJ1k1jo1_500.png"/></a></p><p>This map may look biased towards being close to my work but it really only covers about a 10km radius around the city, we don&#8217;t want to be in the CBD and my work just happens to be in a nice area.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re looking to rent a two bedroom apartment for around $400/week but our <strong>number one priority</strong> is close location to work. The green areas are all close. Our list of travel options in my order of preference:</p>



<ol><li>Cycling</li>

<li>Walking</li>

<li>Ferry (The City Cat, which <a href="http://www.monocle.com/webprogrammes/Quality-of-Life-Index/CityCat-Brisbane/">Monocle rates highly</a>)</li>

<li>Train with no transfers</li>

</ol><p>If I can&#8217;t commute to work within 15 or 20 minutes each way using those modes of transport the place isn&#8217;t suitable. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve chosen the areas we have. There&#8217;s a huge abundance of dedicated bike paths, train lines and ferry terminals lining the river.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>ABC News:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>A 15-year-old Brisbane boy with Asperger&#8217;s syndrome who went missing for two weeks has been found in Sydney, after riding his bike more than 950 kilometres down the Pacific Highway.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Absolutely incredible. I greatly admire this kid&#8217;s determination, resolve and physical endurance. I&#8217;m also impressed with his parents for acting rationally when they noticed him withdrawing money from his bank account by depositing extra funds so he&#8217;d have enough to pay for food.</p>



<p>The huge distances he covered day after day resemble the type of riding required to race a tour. A cycling team should pick him up.</p>
