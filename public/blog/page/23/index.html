  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I remember not enjoying the Harry Potter movies I had seen but after getting my movies up to date with the books I&#8217;ve read over the past few days I realised what&#8217;s missing.</p>



<p>Each Harry Potter book has a primary plot, whatever&#8217;s in the title, The Prisoner of Azkaban, The Goblet of Fire, etc. Problem is, the main story isn&#8217;t all that interesting. What is interesting is the day to day life of witches and wizards. I care little about fighting dementors but I&#8217;m intrigued by the invisibility cloak. The constrained format of a feature film means less time on the superfluous albeit interesting details.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote>Now, I have nothing against cars. Actually, I like cars. They can be useful and fun. Unfortunately, the problem is that many people who operate cars don&#8217;t realize they&#8217;re operating machines, and this is because cars have become so coddling that operating one requires only slightly more effort than watching the Tour de France on your sofa in a state of semi-consciousness while wearing a pair of adult diapers. Yes, the roads are full of bloated vehicles driven by people who need interior microclimates and crow&#8217;s nest vantage points and nine airbags and DVD players to distract their kids and 70-point monitoring systems to keep them awake. Meanwhile, some people think the answer is more efficient cars or alternative energy sources. I strongly disagree. The answer is legislation requiring that all cars have manual transmissions, no airbags, and carbeurated, air-cooled engines with no more than 1500cc displacement. That way, people would actually need to know how to drive, and they&#8217;d also have to pay attention to what they were doing.</blockquote>I couldn&#8217;t agree more with (most of) <a href="http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2009/07/simplify-less-is-less.html">Bike Snob&#8217;s stance on cars</a>.

	        <h2 class="entry-title">Alternative iPhone Ringtones</h2>
	      
			
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m not one to fuck around with ringtones on my phone. I choose the closest sound to a real ringing phone and leave it at that forever. But as more people get iPhones more people are using that same ringtone.</p>



<p>iTunes supports creating and buying ringtones made of songs but that&#8217;s not for me, I don&#8217;t associate songs with a ringing phone and don&#8217;t want to.</p>



<p>Turns out if you have iLife installed on your Mac there&#8217;s a rich vein of relatively unique and very much ringtone-like audio loops right on your computer. Navigate to <code>/Library/Audio/Apple Loops/Apple/iLife Sound Effects/Jingles</code>. In there you&#8217;ll find a bunch of loops which by default will open in Apple Loops Utility but can also be played in Quicktime. You can also quickly listen to a bunch by opening the music and sound effects pane and navigating to that folder in iMovie. My favourites are the broadcast news series, flurry, harbor, heroes and the pastel series.</p>



<p>To get them on your iPhone open them in Quicktime and export them as mp3 or aiff files.  Then I used the very simple and straight-forward <a href="http://www.ambrosiasw.com/utilities/itoner/">iToner</a> to transfer those files to the phone as ringtones. After syncing they&#8217;ll appear in your ringtone selection list on the phone under the custom heading. Unfortunately custom ringtones aren&#8217;t supported for message tones.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><img src="/assets/tumblr/oaQecruTZpyffpfpLwTKUWg0o1_500.jpg"/><br/><p>My bike was returned from the police warehouse this morning. Not being able to remember a single detail first hand, it reveals the most yet about my accident. The top tube and down tube have crumpled, almost snapping in half. The left of the handlebars is bent backwards which explains the deep laceration on my left hand. The connections to the bottom bracket, not shown in this photo, have snapped clean away.</p>



<p>Incredibly there is zero damage to either wheel, not even a punctured tube. The bike damage tells me I was able to turn away in a last second attempt to avoid the car, which obviously wasn&#8217;t enough. Seeing the bike in this horrific state makes my stability and recovery to this point feel even more miraculous.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><img src="/assets/tumblr/oaQecruTZpvjzpyaXHNdNH8Xo1_r1_500.jpg"/><br/><p>That&#8217;s me in the Princess Alexandra hospital emergency room 9 days ago. Apparently a car failed to give way causing an unavoidable collision on my usual Saturday training ride, although I have absolutely no recollection of riding my bike that day, the accident, the ambulance or the 10 hours that followed in the emergency room. I was told what happened and where I was but if you&#8217;d asked me I couldn&#8217;t have told you anything. As far as my memory serves me I was getting a haircut on Saturday morning and the next thing I&#8217;m waking up in the high dependency trauma ward 24 hours later.</p>



<p>Forgetting is a defence mechanism and I&#8217;m thankful for it. Memories of the crash may have prevented me ever getting on the road again.</p>



<p>The 7 days I spent in the high dependency ward are a blur, I was under a heavy vale of drugs and only vaguely remember doctor&#8217;s, friend&#8217;s and family&#8217;s visits. At the time I felt reasonably alert but my friends are still repeating things I said during that time that I don&#8217;t remember saying.</p>



<p>I broke my jaw, nose, left eye socket, both cheeks, five ribs in my back, nine vertebrae  and punctured my left lung. They assured me that the vertebrae were &#8220;stable&#8221; breaks that would not need to be operated on and would heal in time. This is contrary to what I used to believe about broken backs. I&#8217;d been under the impression that a broken back was the end, it meant paraplegia, quadriplegia or death. If the break is stable that&#8217;s simply not the case, my arms, legs and body are totally functional.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s not much you can do about broken ribs and my back was stable but my face needed to be fixed. I had also sliced open my carotid artery, the vein that takes blood from the heart to the brain, so surgery on my face operation was delayed until the 5th day in hospital.</p>



<p>I spent 6 hours in surgery and had 9 titanium plates put into my face. Most were put in through cuts in my mouth but some around my left eye. The surgeons wanted a symmetrical arrangement of plates but my left cheek was so destroyed that there was nothing to attach plates to on that side. They considered taking a piece of my skull and using that but ended up making do and are happy with the result. The anaesthetic process for that operation is my most traumatic memory of the whole experience. It involved a painful combination of tubes up my nose and down my throat and I remember wondering how on earth it was possible that <em>this</em> was the process that was supposed to <em>suppress</em> pain.</p>



<p>Before the operation I was a mess of tubes, IV drips and monitoring equipment including a catheter. After the operation my recovery improved greatly and I was pleased to get rid of some of the equipment. A couple of days later I was able to remove the morphine and my pain button which were causing me extreme tiredness and impeding my recovery. Later I moved from the high dependency ward next door to the more relaxed, quiet and pleasant orthopaedic ward.</p>



<p>Quickly I was able to start walking and having real showers independently. The hospital started to feel less like an aid to my recovery and more like a hindrance. I&#8217;d never been a hospital patient before and hadn&#8217;t noticed what a horrible place it was in my first few drug-addled days. But now with a clearer mind and more independence my progress felt stifled and I pushed hard for a discharge which I was granted yesterday.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m now staying at my Mum&#8217;s for a few days as a half way house between hospital and home. The difference being out of hospital makes is incredible, I feel myself getting stronger and feeling better almost by the hour and I&#8217;m hoping to be back home before the weekend and back at work, at least in some sort of part time arrangement within another two weeks.</p>



<p>My face is still significantly swollen to the point where I barely recognise myself. I only saw my face in the mirror for the first time 7 days after the operation and was shocked by what I saw, it wasn&#8217;t me. Meanwhile everyone was remarking on how improved my face was looking on each visit. I&#8217;m glad I didn&#8217;t see it earlier. I&#8217;ve been working hard over the last few days with the ice pack trying to get the swelling down and it&#8217;s bearing results but there&#8217;s still much progress to be made.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m getting the remaining 30 or so stitches taken out of my face this afternoon which I&#8217;m looking forward to because it means I&#8217;ll be able to finally shave.</p>



<p>I had a great number of family and friends visiting during my stay in hospital and every one of them had a positive affect. My girlfriend Kristin spent the most time beside my bed and has been a glorious shining light through this ordeal. She&#8217;s been with me every day, sometimes for marathon shifts of time, taking care of my every wish and need. I couldn&#8217;t have asked for more, I&#8217;m deeply thankful to have her and owe her a great deal.</p>



<p>As for exactly what happened I&#8217;m still not sure. The policeman taking the case has since taken leave and won&#8217;t be back until next Wednesday when I&#8217;ll hopefully be able to call and find out some solid details. Soon after the accident I do remember a woman visiting me in hospital and breathlessly telling me she was there, saw what happened, called the ambulance and diverted traffic before rushing off. I was only capable of thanking her but wish I&#8217;d at least taken some contact information, I&#8217;d like to talk to her now. There&#8217;s a chance that the whole interaction is a figment of my imagination.</p>



<p>During my stay I met many victims of motorcycle accidents who despite wearing thousands of dollars worth of safety equipment had been totally mangled at low speed. How I was able to keep the overall damage to my body so minimal blows my mind. I was wearing <em>lyrca</em> yet outside of my face and few broken bones in my back, there&#8217;s barely a scratch on my body. Kristin tells me there&#8217;s not a single scratch on my helmet.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t know the state of my bike, it remains in the police warehouse. I was wearing my best riding gear which was completely cut off by paramedics. My iPhone, which was sitting in my back jersey pocket, is totally unharmed. I&#8217;m assured that the accident was not my fault and that I should be fully reimbursed for the cost of my bike and gear but I greatly fear the rigmarole of getting lawyers involved.</p>



<p>The only other patients I met in hospital were victims of road accident. I knew the roads were dangerous but It was frightening first hand evidence of just how incredibly dangerous they really are. That said, I&#8217;m not giving up cycling and I&#8217;m looking forward to getting back out there with better safety equipment. I&#8217;ve been meaning to join a team for a long time and now, once I&#8217;m 100% mobile again, is the perfect time. A single cyclist is difficult to see a group is impossible to miss.</p>



<p>The accident means I&#8217;ve had to pull out of the Yeppoon Half Ironman I was training to compete in next month. They&#8217;ve graciously refunded my entry fees. I&#8217;m bitterly disappointed to miss out but don&#8217;t want to let this get in the way of my goal to compete at the Australian Ironman next year. I&#8217;m unbelievably lucky that I did so little damage to myself in the grand scheme of things, I have to take advantage of that and bounce back stronger than ever.</p>



<p><strong>Update</strong>: I got <a href="http://valhallaisland.com/blog/2009/142504150">my bike</a> back from the police.</p>

<ol><li>It&#8217;d be cool to watch more movies, maybe I should get a Quickflix membership.</li>

<li>Do I really need to watch more movies? I&#8217;m already so busy and there&#8217;s so much other, more productive things I should and want to be doing.</li>

<li>Stop kidding yourself, just relax and watch a fucking movie. Better to relax properly than spend hours getting nothing done in front of the computer. Then when you <em>are</em> on the computer, it&#8217;ll be productive time.</li>

<li>You&#8217;re right but even though I have a nice big TV, my computer chair is more comfortable than my crappy couch anyway, why not just download movies and watch them on the computer?</li>

<li>Then I forget about Quickflix.</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Or how to turn potentially useful, interesting and enjoyable web services into quota padding self promotional chores while contributing nothing but unoriginal and vapid noise to the internet.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t understand social media people at all. They suck all the fun and appeal out of everything in the interest of promoting themselves to people who&#8217;ve sucked the fun and appeal out of everything in the interest of promoting themselves. It&#8217;s a massive circle jerk void of any substance, originality, integrity or expertise.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Create a smart playlist with the rule: Play count → is in the range → 5 → to → 10. Play on shuffle. That&#8217;s it. If you&#8217;re one to rate your music add the rule: Rating → is → no stars. Finds music you like enough to listen to more than a few times but leaves out the music you obviously love because you&#8217;ve listened to it heaps (or rated it highly). As time goes on it&#8217;ll curate songs itself.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was very late to the Instapaper scene. I&#8217;m notoriously good at ignoring things that don&#8217;t immediately please me visually (while taking too much notice of stuff that does) which may have extended the delay, Instapaper is no doubt ugly on the web.</p>



<p>A few weeks ago I stopped ignoring it, installed the bookmarklet and saved a few articles mainly from the fantastic <a href="http://givemesomethingtoread.com/">Give Me Something to Read</a>. A week later the <a href="http://blog.instapaper.com/post/127689346">iPhone app went on sale for half price</a>. Obviously a sign, I bought the app and have since replaced my current novel with what is the best way to read anything online.</p>



<p>Instapaper strips out advertising, images and other bullshit. You&#8217;re left with perfectly legible text formatted how you&#8217;d like (17px Georgia on a dark background). Tilt to scroll and turn off rotation to read while lying on your side, an option I wish every rotating app provided.</p>



<p>With the Kindle not available in Australia I&#8217;ve wanted to use my iPhone as a reading device but hadn&#8217;t found a satisfactory experience. Navigation has been the obstacle, flicking or dragging is too labour-intensive to read anything of substance on a screen that can&#8217;t fit all that much text. Instapaper solves the problem with tilt scrolling and the experience is flawless. I&#8217;m using my iPhone more, reading more, learning more and enjoying it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,25685748-661,00.html">$90 Million</a></p><p>It&#8217;s Australia&#8217;s biggest ever lotto jackpot and everyone&#8217;s eyes have turned to dollar signs. The greater amount of people buying tickets means that even if by slim chance you do win statistically the chances are higher it&#8217;ll be split between multiple people, bringing it inline with every other lottery jackpot most people have the sense to not participate in.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As the initial stream of golden ideas for iPhone apps seem to be running dry, a slew of these database-of-things-style apps are entering the store. The iPhone is great for many things — taking photos, sending messages, updating Twitter, checking email, data entry and library management is not one of those things. I can&#8217;t think of anything more tedious or useless than maintaining a database of <em>anything</em> stored solely on a single iPhone.</p>
