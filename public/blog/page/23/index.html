  <div class="entry-content"><p>Or how to turn potentially useful, interesting and enjoyable web services into quota padding self promotional chores while contributing nothing but unoriginal and vapid noise to the internet.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t understand social media people at all. They suck all the fun and appeal out of everything in the interest of promoting themselves to people who&#8217;ve sucked the fun and appeal out of everything in the interest of promoting themselves. It&#8217;s a massive circle jerk void of any substance, originality, integrity or expertise.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Create a smart playlist with the rule: Play count → is in the range → 5 → to → 10. Play on shuffle. That&#8217;s it. If you&#8217;re one to rate your music add the rule: Rating → is → no stars. Finds music you like enough to listen to more than a few times but leaves out the music you obviously love because you&#8217;ve listened to it heaps (or rated it highly). As time goes on it&#8217;ll curate songs itself.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was very late to the Instapaper scene. I&#8217;m notoriously good at ignoring things that don&#8217;t immediately please me visually (while taking too much notice of stuff that does) which may have extended the delay, Instapaper is no doubt ugly on the web.</p>



<p>A few weeks ago I stopped ignoring it, installed the bookmarklet and saved a few articles mainly from the fantastic <a href="http://givemesomethingtoread.com/">Give Me Something to Read</a>. A week later the <a href="http://blog.instapaper.com/post/127689346">iPhone app went on sale for half price</a>. Obviously a sign, I bought the app and have since replaced my current novel with what is the best way to read anything online.</p>



<p>Instapaper strips out advertising, images and other bullshit. You&#8217;re left with perfectly legible text formatted how you&#8217;d like (17px Georgia on a dark background). Tilt to scroll and turn off rotation to read while lying on your side, an option I wish every rotating app provided.</p>



<p>With the Kindle not available in Australia I&#8217;ve wanted to use my iPhone as a reading device but hadn&#8217;t found a satisfactory experience. Navigation has been the obstacle, flicking or dragging is too labour-intensive to read anything of substance on a screen that can&#8217;t fit all that much text. Instapaper solves the problem with tilt scrolling and the experience is flawless. I&#8217;m using my iPhone more, reading more, learning more and enjoying it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As the initial stream of golden ideas for iPhone apps seem to be running dry, a slew of these database-of-things-style apps are entering the store. The iPhone is great for many things — taking photos, sending messages, updating Twitter, checking email, data entry and library management is not one of those things. I can&#8217;t think of anything more tedious or useless than maintaining a database of <em>anything</em> stored solely on a single iPhone.</p>

An extremely powerful desktop running two massive screens in combination with a relatively low spec but small and portable laptop. Power and screen space where portability doesn&#8217;t matter and portability where power and screen space doesn&#8217;t matter. Perfectly complimentary.</p>



<p>I was running a junior version of this setup while at university. 24&#8221; iMac at home and 12&#8221; PowerBook out and about. It remains the best computer combination I&#8217;ve used. Now I&#8217;m in an awkward situation with a not-small laptop that&#8217;s more powerful than my desktop, I don&#8217;t like it but my requirements are unusual and my options are limited.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001280.html">This post about the iPhone</a> from long time Windows developer and lover Jeff Atwood could not be more uncomfortable. Like an 8-year-old boy talking about the girl he has a crush on, he&#8217;s falling over himself trying to say good things about the iPhone without looking like he&#8217;s totally gay for Apple.</p>



<p>Jeff admits he hasn&#8217;t owned an Apple product for 25 years and that lack of experience with Macs is obvious:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>There&#8217;s always been a weird tension in Apple&#8217;s computer designs, because they attempt to control every nuance of the entire experience from end to end. For the best Apple™ experience, you run custom Apple™ applications on artfully designed Apple™ hardware dongles.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Apple&#8217;s hardware and software work great together with Apple&#8217;s peripherals, as a computer user that <em>reduces</em> the tension for me significantly.</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>All those things that bugged me about Apple&#8217;s computers are utter non-issues in the phone market. Proprietary handset? So is every other handset. Locked in to a single vendor? Everyone signs a multi-year contract. One company controlling your entire experience? That&#8217;s how it&#8217;s always been done.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Oh, so that weird tension Apple™ creates by only offering the best Apple™ experience with Apple™ hardware, Apple™ software and Apple™ peripherals doesn&#8217;t bother you at all in a market where <em>actually</em> being locked in by way of contract is the status quo. The same way I&#8217;m cool with treating women like dirt when I&#8217;m hanging out with my Saudi Arabian friends.</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Apple has never been particularly great at supporting software developers [&#8230;]</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Except when it comes to providing a full suite of developer tools with the operating system and offering developer connection subscriptions both completely free rather than <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-au/subscriptions/subscriptionschart.aspx">charging the 1000s of dollars Microsoft does</a>, yeah they&#8217;re not great at supporting developers.</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>If this has all come across as too rah-rah, too uncritical a view of the iPhone, I apologize. There are certainly things to be critical about, such as the App Store&#8217;s weird enforcement policies, the lack of support for emulators, or Flash, or anything else that might somehow undermine the platform as decided in some paranoid, secretive Apple back room. Not that we&#8217;d ever hear about it.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>God <em>forbid</em> you give an uncritical review of something you obviously love. Quick, ridicule Apple&#8217;s secretiveness, that&#8217;ll do. Lack of support for Flash or emulators couldn&#8217;t possibly be a trade-off to improve phone experience you&#8217;re currently lauding as a whole.</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>I didn&#8217;t write this to kiss Apple&#8217;s ass.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>You <em>didn&#8217;t</em>?! And here I was about to call you an Apple fanboi because there&#8217;s no way a phone could actually be <em>that good</em>. Up until now I thought your review must be based on unwavering loyalty to the Apple brand, not the phone&#8217;s merits.</p>



<p>This is a long standing dilemma for Mac users and lovers trying to communicate the virtues of the platform with Windows users. We use Macs because it&#8217;s a better, friction less experience, not because we&#8217;re married to Apple. I can only assume that it&#8217;s because they&#8217;re so tragically hardened by their long-standing, endless, multiple computer battle trying to force Windows to do what they want that they simply cannot believe or don&#8217;t want to believe (they&#8217;ve already invested SO. MUCH. TIME. ALREADY) that a computer exists without those problems that&#8217;s a joy to use.</p>



<p>On a greater scale than the iPod, the iPhone is going lure in a huge amount of non-Mac users. There&#8217;s little barrier to finding out what a joyful, easy experience it can be when a company that cares about user experience and good design creates a product, hardware, software, peripherals and from the ground up to work together. A lot of people, even curmudgeonly old Windows developers, will hang up their hang ups about being &#8220;forced&#8221; to buy a great computer to run great software and will enjoy the computer again just as they enjoy their new phones.</p>

<p>For the entire length of this song the crowd was silent. Not one person of the 200 strong crowd took advantage of the silence to yell something stupid or anything at all. Every note and every word rang out as if in a vacuum. It was a surreal moment.</p>

You&#8217;d keep the big screen experience and the audio quality but wouldn&#8217;t have to put up with the noise from other moviegoers. Drive-thrus have done it from the beginning.

  <p>This seems to be a prevalent feeling. To most people, the computer is an annoying tool that they reluctantly use because their job requires it, and mobile phones are a way for their boss to reach them wherever they are, creating an expectation of constant availability for “working”.</p>

  

  <p>I’ve never viewed my connected technology this way. Yes, computers and phones are a way for me to be connected to my work. But they’re also my play, my hobby, my leisure, my education, my exposure to society, and my enlightenment. I like this connection.</p>

<p>I feel exactly the same way as <a href="http://www.marco.org/50873688">Marco</a>. The attitude amongst most people I know is that the computer is an inherently bad thing. Sure it&#8217;s convenient to do some things and a requirement for others but at its core the computer is <em>bad</em> and must be excluded or avoided wherever possible. I can&#8217;t help but think it has something to do with the pain that is using Windows.</p>

Also known as a 70.3 (miles), it&#8217;s two and a half times longer than anything I&#8217;ve entered before. It&#8217;s one of the earliest and apparently easiest of the qualifying races for Ironman Australia. I&#8217;m shitting myself.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Almost every time I use Maps I wish I had a compass but I barely use the iPhone&#8217;s 3G&#8217;s still camera as it is and I&#8217;m not into convincing myself I&#8217;ll use it more often if the quality is better of if I can shoot video too. So I hadn&#8217;t considered upgrading. Until I saw <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gruber/tags/iphone3gscomparison/">some of the speed comparisons</a>. Apps not only load and launch more quickly but it&#8217;s obvious just how much more responsive to interaction the 3G S is. Now I&#8217;m very interested in what my (still totally silent on the 3G S) <a href="http://personal.optus.com.au/web/ocaportal.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=Template_wRHS&amp;FP=/personal/mobile/iphone3G&amp;site=personal">carrier</a> offers existing 3G customers.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><img src="/assets/tumblr/oaQecruTZoyo0lkk0vV44xGQo1_500.jpg"/><br/><p>Australia&#8217;s new 24 hour free to air sports channel airs NASCAR races live pretty often. Up until last week I&#8217;d never had any exposure to NASCAR and I thought that the driving round in circles and making left turns thing was an exaggerated joke. Turns out, <a href="http://www.nascar.com/races/tracks/">it&#8217;s not</a>, they actually drive hundreds of laps around big ovals in different cities. As dumb as it seems I have to say that I respect their ability to do one thing and do it extremely well.</p>
