<p>Marco Arment as part of his argument for writing posts about bathroom fans and pillowcasing strategies:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Installing timer switches on my bathroom fans has eliminated a <em>daily</em> annoyance from my life. Deciding on a pillowcasing strategy has made me sleep more comfortably <em>every night</em> since I wrote that stupid article seven years ago.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;m with Marco. Finding ways to automate and streamline parts of your life should be a continual pursuit. Think about how many times you&#8217;ve lost your keys and how much time and frustration you&#8217;d have saved if years ago you purposefully decided you were going to put your keys in the same place every day forever.</p>
