<p>Blueseed is an idea to fit out a ship off the coast of California in international waters that will allow &#8220;boldest, brightest, and most talented tech entrepreneurs&#8221; to start a business with little immigration overhead.</p>

<p>If this ridiculous idea got off the ground it would be the physical manifestation of the life destroying culture of working yourself into the ground to make a startup succeed. That is, get acquired. I can&#8217;t think of anything I&#8217;d want less than to isolate myself on an island, bunking with four others in a tiny space while working in an environment where I&#8217;m expected to give up everything to make a venture capitalist rich.</p>

<p>What a nightmare.</p>
