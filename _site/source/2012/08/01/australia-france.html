<p>I&#8217;ve been in France for over a month now staying in Grenoble while <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/jimwhimpey/'>riding my bike through the French alps</a>. In my time here I&#8217;ve noticed a lot of small differences between our countries and cultures. These kind of differences and the circumstances that brought them about fascinates me.</p>

<h3 id='cars_and_driving'>Cars and Driving</h3>

<p>90% of cars are hatchbacks, the other 10% are vans. I have seen one 4X4 and one ute in a month.</p>

<p>Traffic lights are minimal, not in frequency but in each installation. There is only one large set of lights and one small set of lights (for bicycles) for each direction of traffic. Each set is on the close side of the intersection so if cars roll too far into the intersection they can&#8217;t see the lights change.</p>

<p>Traffic lights have no buttons for pedestrians nor pressure sensors for cars. They cycle based on time and nothing else. From what I can tell the cycle timing never changes.</p>

<p>Taxis are luxury cars. The only BMW, Mercedes and Audis I&#8217;ve seen in France have been taxis. They&#8217;re also minimally branded, the only thing that distinguishes them as cabs from the outside is a small roof mounted sign.</p>

<p>Bicycle commuting is very popular here and bikes are treated as first class road users by cars. Bikes flaunt the road rules constantly yet are never treated in anger or frustration by motorists. Bikes are calmly given right of way in all situations whether they&#8217;re breaking the rules or not.</p>

<h3 id='supermarkets_and_food'>Supermarkets and Food</h3>

<p>Supermarkets sell alcohol.</p>

<p>Cashiers have seats.</p>

<p>Cashiers don&#8217;t bag your groceries, you do.</p>

<p>You won&#8217;t be given plastic bags unless you explicitly ask for them and often they cost a small amount. From what I&#8217;ve seen almost everyone has their own bags/trolley/basket.</p>

<p>Cafes rarely serve anything more than the most basic pre-prepared food, often not even that.</p>

<p>&#8220;American style&#8221; bread (i.e. non-baguette sliced bread loafs) come almost exclusively in half loaves (compared to Australian loaf size).</p>

<p>Drinks are measured in centilitres.</p>

<p>Coke cans come in 33cl, bottles come in 50cl and bottle caps are about 5mm shallower than bottles back home (<em>tiny</em> differences like that are interesting to me).</p>

<h3 id='other_stuff'>Other Stuff</h3>

<p>ATMs dispense various denominations. For example, if you ask for €100 the default is usually 1 x 50, 2 x 20 and 1 x 10. Often you can specify the exact denominations, i.e. get €100 in ten 10s if you want.</p>

<p>French computer keyboards are <a href='http://www.zacheverson.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/french-layout.gif'>frustratingly similar</a> to the English qwerty layout. <em>Numbers</em> require the shift modifier!</p>

<p>Cigarette smoking is <em>much</em> more common here and heavily skews young. It seems everyone in their 20s here smokes and that&#8217;s rare back home.</p>

<p>Dogs are allowed everywhere: on buses, trains, in shops, in restaurants. A couple walked into a restaurant in Briançon with their beagle. They sat down, their beagle sat up on the third chair and stayed there while they ate their meals.</p>
