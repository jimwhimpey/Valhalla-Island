<p>Reddit user mr17five does <a href='http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/xtl8k/is_not_joining_facebook_a_sign_youre_a_psychopath/c5ptvyk'>a great job tearing down</a> a terrible article <a href='http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2184658/Is-joining-Facebook-sign-youre-psychopath-Some-employers-psychologists-say-suspicious.html?ICO=most_read_module'>from the Daily Mail</a> about the way not being on Facebook makes you a potential psychopath:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The article sets out to immediately assert that facebook is &#8220;such a pervasive force in modern society&#8221; that it would almost be foolish not to have one. This is known as <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum'>argumentum ad populum</a>, or more commonly &#8220;bandwagon fallacy.&#8221; Just ignore the fact that over six billion people (over 85% of Earth&#8217;s population) do not have facebook accounts.</p>

If you don&#8217;t drink a litre of beetroot juice for breakfast &#8220;some&#8221; &#8220;experts&#8221; &#8220;might&#8221; think that you &#8220;could be&#8221; a &#8220;psychopath&#8221;.</p>
