<p>I simply went without health insurance for awhile to finish Birdfeed (it’s shockingly expensive in New York State—far more even than, say, California), and I know a surprising number of my peers in the indie Mac/iOS community have done the same thing at various points. And we’re the crazy ones. I guarantee you a lot of people are too scared by the cost of health care to even consider starting their own businesses.</p>

<p>Having been born and grown up in <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia'>a country</a> that provides free healthcare to all its citizens, having seen the care provided to almost everyone I know and <a href='http://valhallaisland.com/blog/2009/141205452/'>myself personally</a> (warning: a little gore) over the years, it is difficult for me to even comprehend the idea of going without health insurance in the USA.</p>

<p>If I understand the situation correctly, when a US citizen gets sick or injured without insurance, they have a choice between getting zero treatment, and therefore potential death or lifetime disability, or complete financial ruin.</p>

<p>Even if they have insurance, the insurance provider is a huge corporation who&#8217;s profits depend on <em>not providing coverage</em>.</p>

<p>I still can&#8217;t fathom it.</p>
