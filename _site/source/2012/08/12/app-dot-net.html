<p>Me, <a href='https://twitter.com/jimwhimpey/status/218849763532087296'>four months ago</a>:</p>

<p>Build Twitter as it existed years ago, mimic the APIs simply with a different host and I think you&#8217;d have great success.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s <a href='https://join.app.net/'>App.net</a>. The opaquely named and described (&#8220;real-time social feed&#8221;) service that&#8217;ll be a Twitter alternative, <a href='https://github.com/appdotnet/api-spec/blob/master/objects.md'>mimicing the API</a> and asking for money from users instead of advertisers.</p>

<p>I love Twitter but it&#8217;s been moving in <a href='https://dev.twitter.com/blog/delivering-consistent-twitter-experience'>an uncomfortable direction</a> contrary to my desired use of the service (i.e. never via the website or official clients) for a while.</p>

<p>App.net&#8217;s ideology matches mine:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We believe that advertising-supported social services are so consistently and inextricably at odds with the interests of users and developers that something must be done.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;m glad they&#8217;re taking it on but I have two concerns.<p /></p>

<p>Firstly, why fund this using the Kickstarter model? It&#8217;s a software project <a href='https://alpha.app.net/global/'>already well underway</a>, I don&#8217;t know why a huge capital base is required. They haven&#8217;t taken a single dollar to this point and they&#8217;ll be taking on paying customers once the services is live. Is the half million just to fund development between the alpha and launch? The Kickstarter-like fundraiser feels like a gimmicky cash grab to me. It&#8217;s certainly been good for proving demand exists but there&#8217;s a reason ongoing projects like these are against Kickstarter&#8217;s terms of service.</p>

<p>As of this writing they&#8217;re $40k away from the goal with 45 hours remaining. It looks like they&#8217;ll reach the $500k but what if they fell, say, $5k short? Would they abandon an idea they&#8217;ve already partially implemented that there&#8217;s obviously significant demand for? I doubt it.</p>

<p>Secondly, $50/year is <em>a lot</em>. I&#8217;m all for software financially supported by users but a social networks&#8217;s value increases exponentially as the user base grows. $50 is a significant barrier to growth, especially when there&#8217;s established and completely free competition. I think limited free plus premium paid accounts (Ã  la Flickr and Strava) makes more sense in this context. That said, I&#8217;ve pre-registered an account and I&#8217;ll be happy to be proven wrong.</p>
