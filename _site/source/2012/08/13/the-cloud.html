<p>It makes sense to me as a marketing tool to non-technical people: <em>&#34;this internet stuff is really expensive, complicated and often the source of problems, simplifying it is desirable&#34;</em>. But as a web developer who often finds himself administrating systems the idea of applications and infrastructure being as simple as a <em>cloud</em> is almost offensive.</p>

<p>It really bothers me is when it&#8217;s used in a technical context. See <a href='http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/'>The Rackspace Open <em>Cloud</em> with Public, Private and Hybrid <em>Clouds</em></a>. If I&#8217;m at the Rackspace website I&#8217;m in the market for off-site web hosting. I know what I want and need: a computer hooked up to the internet in a datacenter, not a cloud.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a marketing term designed to make the complexity seem like magic. It&#8217;s <em>my job</em> to make that that complexity seem like magic and I don&#8217;t like it being treated as though it&#8217;s as simple as purchasing your very own &#8220;hybrid cloud&#8221;.</p>
