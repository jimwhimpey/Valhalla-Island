<p>Speaker docks for iPhones, iPods and iPads are <a href='http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=sr_st?keywords=iPod+dock&amp;qid=1344460095&amp;rh=k%3AiPod+dock%2Cn%3A172282&amp;sort=-price'>expensive, ugly or offer plain terrible sound quality</a>. Often they&#8217;re all three yet they&#8217;re popular. Your iOS device is a great interface for browsing and selecting music having to <em>dock it</em> significantly diminishes that experience.</p>

<p>For a couple years I&#8217;ve been running a great sounding, good looking and <em>cheap</em> sound system based on Apple&#8217;s Airport Express which any of my devices or computers can wirelessly interface. I couldn&#8217;t be happier with the setup yet it seems surprisingly rare. Here are the details and the cost breakdown:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href='http://store.apple.com/us/product/MC414LL/A?fnode=4d'>Apple Airport Express</a> — $99</li>

<li><a href='http://www.hifiengine.com/library/kenwood/ka-3700.shtml'>1970s 20W Kenwood KA-3700</a> — Bought up on Ebay for $80.</li>

<li><a href='http://imgc.classistatic.com/cps/blnc/120501/617r1/98077l7_20.jpeg'>Philips AK285 passive speakers</a> — $0, sitting under Mum&#8217;s stairs unused.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can&#8217;t buy an amp exactly like this new but a lot of low-powered, 1970s Japanese-made amps were made and there&#8217;s many available second hand. Similar models were made by Marantz, Pioneer, Sansui and Yamaha. My exact model is for sale (as of this time of writing) <a href='http://www.ebay.com.au/itm/Trio-Kenwood-KA-3700-Classic-Silver-Amplifier-Vintage-1970s-Amp-DERBY-DE24-/130744341006?pt=UK_AudioTVElectronics_HomeAudioHiFi_Amplifiers&amp;hash=item1e70f8520e'>on Ebay for $88</a>. A little hunting and patience and you&#8217;ll find a great deal. Alternatively, check the storage cupboards of your parents/aunties/uncles/grandparents. <em>Everyone</em> used to have these hooked up to their phonographs and you might be surprised by how many are floating around your extended family unused. Seriously.</p>

<p>Despite modern models made by these same manufactures costing 10× more the electronics powering them have changed very little and sound quality is indistinguishable to a regular listener. They lack features like remote controls and many input options but these are unnecessary when used with an Airport Express.</p>

<p>While I was lucky to get a free set of speakers, the exact same pair can be found second hand <a href='http://www.gumtree.com.au/s-ad/bibra-lake/audio/philips-ak285-30-speakers-50-watts-/1001859758'>on Gumtree for $80</a>. Similar sets come up on Ebay all the time but even a nice set of new passive bookshelf speakers <a href='http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=sr_nr_p_36_2?rh=n%3A172282%2Cn%3A%21493964%2Cn%3A667846011%2Cn%3A3236449011%2Cn%3A172563%2Ck%3Abookshelf+speakers%2Cp_36%3A1253505011&amp;bbn=172563&amp;keywords=bookshelf+speakers&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1344507135&amp;rnid=386442011'>don&#8217;t cost a great deal</a>.</p>

<p>Any device or computer running iOS or Mac OS connected to your wireless network can stream music to the Airport Express attached to the amplifier using the magic of <a href='http://www.apple.com/itunes/airplay/'>Airplay</a>. That means you can use iTunes, the great Music apps on your iOS device, the <a href='http://itunes.apple.com/au/app/remote/id284417350?mt=8'>iOS Remote app</a> playing music from your computer or <em>any other audio producing app</em> (including YouTube, Spotify, Rdio) to wirelessly send audio to your hifi setup.</p>

<p>With my full music collection on my computer most commonly I&#8217;ll use the Remote app on my iPhone or iPad to select music on my computer which is played through my hifi system using Airplay. When people see me do this it blows their minds.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a great experience to lay in your bedroom or sit outside, search for and select music to play from the big music collection on your computer using your iPhone and have it play through your high quality hifi system in your lounge room. Even the volume can be controlled remotely. Compare it to having to get up to skip a song on a docked iPhone, hit next on a computer keyboard or seek through a CD.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m no audiophile (and have nothing but sympathy for those who are) but the quality of sound out of this system is fantastic. Despite the low wattage it&#8217;s loud too, much louder than I could ever turn it up in my apartment building.</p>

<p>This setup is one of the very few things, especially in the world of electronics, that isn&#8217;t only ideal in its quality and usability but is also low cost and accessible. If I lived in a bigger home I&#8217;d replicate it in every room.</p>
