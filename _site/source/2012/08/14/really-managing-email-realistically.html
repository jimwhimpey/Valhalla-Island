<p>Matt Gemmell <em>gets real</em> in his piece, <a href='http://mattgemmell.com/2012/08/05/managing-email-realistically/'>Managing Email Realistically</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You, however, are a normal person, and the time you’d spend on all those formal task-management rituals is better spent aimlessly surfing the web, or even going home early. You’re just an ordinary lassie or laddie who gets <em>too much goddamned email</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think Matt is out of touch with what is a truly realistic scenario for the ordinary lassie or laddie:</p>

<ol>
<li>Most people don&#8217;t have jobs that require the use (or at least significant use) of email.</li>

<li>Those who do separate their work and personal email completely. That is, outside of office hours they don&#8217;t check their work email and vice versa.</li>

<li>The amount of email people get <em>that actually requires a response at all</em> is very small.</li>
</ol>

<p>His &#34;reply within 24 hours list&#34; betrays his grasp on email reality: clients, luminaries, bloggers, <em>journalists whose names you know</em>, people donating to you and people <em>buying you stuff</em>. Very few people will ever get email from any of these people.</p>

<p>After earlier suggesting GTD systems &#34;are not for normal people; they’re for obsessive-compulsives who just happen to prefer filtering email than counting toothpicks or quadruple-checking that the oven is off&#34; Matt suggests filtering email:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you have multiple projects and clients, chuck the emails in per-project non-inbox folders; your non-work email shouldn’t ever get past ten unanswered messages at any time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But it&#8217;s followed with one of two pieces of advice I agree with:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you literally don’t have time each day to do that simple piece of filing, you’re getting too many work emails, and you need to actively start cultivating a reputation as a simmering psychopath who may or may not bring a weapon into the office if he gets just one more stupid email.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This year I developed a reputation at work for despising meetings and it worked, I&#8217;ve only been invited to one meeting all year to the benefit of my real productivity. I believe technical solutions can alleviate problems like too much email but this kind of &#34;social engineering&#34; really works well.</p>

<p>That combined with automatically deleting (as Matt suggests) or simply unsubscribing from every newsletter, social network notification and PR announcement list will wipe out your email burden to the point where no systems, rules or bankruptcy are required.</p>
