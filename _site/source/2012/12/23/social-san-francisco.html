<p>Mike Davidson recently moved from Seattle to take a job <a href='http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/archive/2012/10/on-joining-twitter'>leading Twitter&#8217;s design team</a> in San Francisco. He&#8217;s <a href='http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/archive/2012/12/we-are-expanding-the-design-team-at-twitter'>noticed some things</a> about the general social vibe here:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>San Francisco, however, much like New York, is more of a melting pot. People come here from all over, don’t have high school and college friends to congregate with all the time, and live in tiny matchboxes, so they are more likely to go out and meet new people.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>The effect isn’t dramatic, but I notice it almost daily. More people make eye contact, more people say hello, and more people go out at night. It’s a nice change of pace.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;ve noticed and have been enjoying the same thing. Without consciously trying I&#8217;ve struck up conversations with people on buses, in elevators, at grocery checkouts and on my bike while waiting for the lights to change. Back home these kinds of interactions would be actively avoided or shut down as quickly as possible. I like it better here.</p>
