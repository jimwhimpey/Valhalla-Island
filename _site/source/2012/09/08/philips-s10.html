<p>Where the small, sharp-edged, rectangle brick does work is as a mobile device you carry everywhere. You never have to carry your landline handset outside of a phone call, optimising the design for that purpose is crazy. I argue that the sharp-edged rectangle brick isn&#8217;t even ideal for a mobile device; the previous curved back iPhone felt more comfortable in hand and the newer iPhone 4 and 4S choose looks over physical comfort. A perfectly fine compromise to make.</p>

<p>But who cares? The iPhone is successful, ignore the context and just copy it! I give it a year until we see iPhone &#8220;inspired&#8221; garage door openers and light switches.</p>
