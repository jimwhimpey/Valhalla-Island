<p>Everyone knows <a href='http://valhallaisland.com/blog/2012/tune-in-turn-off-plug-out/'>how I feel</a> about <a href='http://valhallaisland.com/blog/2012/being-present/'>this kind of behaviour</a> but it <em>really</em> bothers me so I&#8217;m going to go on about it forever.</p>

<p>Using a camera like this is the epitome of not living in the moment. It&#8217;s sacrificing the present so that your future self will be able to reminisce about your past self.</p>
