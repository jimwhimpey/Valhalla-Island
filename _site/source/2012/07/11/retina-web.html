<p>I like how we&#8217;re talking about optimizing for Retina displays when I see sites weighing 3-6MB. Yeah, that&#8217;s the right conversation to have.</p>

<p>For me optimising for retina displays means serving <em>less</em> images, not duplicates at higher resolutions. You can be almost guaranteed your web content being rendered at retina resolution is being rendered by WebKit with advanced CSS support obsoleting the need for many images. Potentially a retina optimised website can look much better and weigh much less than a &#8220;traditionally designed&#8221; website served to a retina screen.</p>
