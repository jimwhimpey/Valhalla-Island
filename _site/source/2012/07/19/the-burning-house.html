<p>If your house was burning, what would you take with you? It&#8217;s a conflict between what&#8217;s practical, valuable and sentimental.</p>

<p>Featuring heavily: cameras, camera lenses, passports, <em>still commercially available books and CDs</em>, printed photographs, headphones and clothing.</p>

<p>The more I think about this question the more I doubt the people participating in this project are trying hard enough. I know it&#8217;s just a fun game to discover what things people find important but imagine people scrambling to take these things if there&#8217;s literally flames crawling up the walls, smoke everywhere, extreme heat, etc.</p>

<p>No one should have a print as their <em>only</em> copy of a photograph. I would hope that while composing these photos the participants realised how dumb it is, immediately scanned the pics and stored the files on their computer and on the internet somewhere. The same goes for any kind of &#8220;letter from grandma&#8221; type document.</p>

<p><a href='http://theburninghouse.com/post/26497459645/silka-frigault'>A Charlotte Bronte book and a psychology textbook</a>!? Jane Eyre can be <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Jane-Eyre-Dover-Thrift-Editions/dp/0486424499'>replaced on Amazon</a> for $4.50. Your house is literally burning down and endangering your life.</p>

<p>I guess people are taking headphones because they can&#8217;t bear to not listen to their favourite music between their house burning down and the next opportunity they might have to buy replacement headphones.</p>

<p>Apparently everyone is planning immediate overseas travel after their house burns down, that&#8217;s why the passport gets saved. Passports are easily replaced, albeit for a price but they all expire and must be replaced at some future point regardless.</p>

<p>A lot of cameras being saved. Some old ones which I imagine would be difficult to replace but mostly new cameras and new lenses. I suppose it&#8217;s to document their flaming homes turning into ashes.</p>

<p>Clothes? Urgh.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s nothing I own that I&#8217;d be truly upset to lose, for me the question is all about degree of inconvenience. Sure it&#8217;d be inconvenient to restore my data from online backups, buy new clothes I like, apply for a new passport, etc. But in the context of life endangerment inconvenience is insignificant.</p>

<p>There. That&#8217;s all the fun sucked out of that.</p>
