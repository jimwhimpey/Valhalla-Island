<p>Brian Lam&#8217;s advice (strangely branded as specifically for San Francisco but applicable everywhere) for loosening your attachment to your phone starts off really well:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pay attention to your date! You are here to try to have sex, which you cannot do online yet. Your phone stays in your pocket. It may ring. It may buzz. You will want to prod it. Donâ€™t.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then it gets a little weird with very specific instructions for how to look cool using an iPad in a cafe:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My only advice is simple: Lean back, cross your legs, relax your shoulders, and hold the tablet on your knee with one hand. Look as if you are reading a newspaper rather than using a computer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Back to good:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Picking up a phone when running says you&#8217;re not running hard enough. Hang up the phone, run faster.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More good advice for those who feel compelled to personally document an entire gig on their phones:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How are you going to dance and drink and throw your sweaty arms around your date when you&#8217;re futzing with your phone?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But then I couldn&#8217;t agree less with Brian on using your phone at the movies:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s a trick I like: Turn the brightness all the way down so you can check your phone during the slow scenes, under a coat.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And how do you satisfy your insatiable thirst for Twitter updates when hanging out with your friends?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Easy. In a lull, just ask if everyone wants to take a phone break. Or just declare, &#8220;phone break!&#8221; and start clicking. Everyone else will follow suit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That doesn&#8217;t sound much like &#8220;tuning in, turning off or plugging out&#8221; to me. It sounds bizarre and if it became acceptable social etiquette I would join the Amish.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re now at the point where someone feels the need to create an illustrated guide for <em>adults</em> on how to <em>show basic manners</em> in social situations. It&#8217;s like a parent telling their four year old to &#8220;say thank-you&#8221; and even the guide author can&#8217;t suggest <em>sitting through a whole movie without checking your phone</em>.</p>

<p>For me all this advice can be distilled to something simpler: be present in your life. Participate in and pay attention to what&#8217;s happening around you <em>right now</em>.</p>
