<p>This afternoon a friend I was keen to chat to and catch up with came to my place to pick up some gear. He was bringing along his kids (3 and 5-years-old) so I quickly scanned around my single, 24-year-old guy, minimal apartment looking for something that might distract them for 20 minutes. I gave up looking.</p>

<p>When they got here they darted directly at the iPad sitting on my couch and I thought &#8220;of course&#8221;!</p>

<p>I sat down with them looking through my games for something they might like. Nothing. I asked if they knew of any good games and it turns out they <em>love</em> Monkey Maths. They watched as I searched the app store. They identified the Monkey Maths icon before I did. I downloaded the free app. It downloaded in 15 seconds and they realised it was ready to play before I did.</p>

<p>I launched the game and asked if they know how to play. They pulled the iPad away from me silently saying <em>of course</em> we know how to play.</p>

<p>They played together with the iPad for a good 20 or 30 minutes while I caught up with my friend. When it was time to go the 3yo hit the home button, followed by the lock button and then expertly closed the smart cover. <em>Three years old</em>.</p>

<p>If I had any doubt left about the future of personal computing that&#8217;s well and truly gone.</p>
