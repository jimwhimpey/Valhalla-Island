<p>Before I left work this afternoon I thought I&#8217;d try a different barber closer to my new office. I checked online and discovered there wasn&#8217;t one as close as what I&#8217;d hoped so I resolved to just stop in at the same barbershop I&#8217;ve been going to for the last couple of years.</p>

<p>When I got there the &#8220;closed&#8221; sign was hanging. I looked at the opening hours on the door: &#8220;Mon-Fri 8am to 5:30pm&#8221;. I looked at my bike computer: 5:14pm. I got the attention of someone inside and asked what was going on. She said it takes them 15 minutes to clean and they won&#8217;t start on someone in the last 15 minutes. I tried to talk her around. She was steadfast.</p>

<p>This pissed me off and I <a href='http://twitter.com/jimwhimpey/status/169321194183593984'>vented on Twitter</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My hair takes 15-20 minutes to cut. I&#8217;ve been going to that barber for years. Not anymore.</p>

<p>I got a <a href='http://twitter.com/freshtonic/status/169327784727023616'>couple</a> of <a href='http://twitter.com/kondro/status/169322614198767616'>responses</a> suggesting it&#8217;s a bit drastic to cut ties considering I&#8217;ve been going there so long.</p>

<p>The fact I&#8217;ve been going there so long is another reason they should have served me. Would it be so difficult to cut someone&#8217;s hair 15 minutes <em>before you close</em>, clean up around me and stay back 5 or 10 minutes? For someone who&#8217;s spent hundreds of dollars there over the years?</p>

<p>There&#8217;s nothing exceptional about this barber and for me, barbers are interchangable. There&#8217;s literally 20 options a short distance from work and home. There&#8217;s nothing at all tying me to my regular barber, they&#8217;re simply one of many very similar options. Serving me after they&#8217;d turned the sign (even though it was 15 minutes before closing) may have created a tie. Instead they&#8217;ve given me a great reason to choose someone else.</p>
