<p>The move from WordPress to Tumblr a few years ago felt great. All the focus was on posting content and I was liberated from the need to administer a blog. Since then Tumblr has struggled with stability problems while implementing weird &#8220;social features&#8221; like photo replies (but no native text replies) and getting obsessed with things like New York Fashion Week. Recently they added these <a href='http://staff.tumblr.com/post/16980189397/highlighted-posts'>dumb labels</a> and I recognised Tumblr is going too far in a direction I&#8217;m not interested in.</p>

<p>I first became interested in (well, aware of) generated flat file publishing systems when I read about Brent&#8217;s <a href='http://inessential.com/2009/01/30/new_publishing_system_tour_of_my_head'>homemade system</a> over three years ago. Only a couple of months after that I got a job working on a site that was using a similar flat file system on a <a href='http://www.abc.net.au/news/'><em>much</em> larger scale</a> (it&#8217;s only recently been replaced). I was intrigued by the big advantages of such a system: speed and simplicity.</p>

<p>My loss of respect for Tumblr coincided with reading about <a href='http://octopress.org/'>Octopress</a> on <a href='http://mattgemmell.com/2011/09/12/blogging-with-octopress/'>Matt Gemmell&#8217;s blog</a>. It sounded perfect. It&#8217;s the kind of new wave of &#8220;hacker&#8221; software that&#8217;s well designed and a joy to use. I credit Github for this great trend.</p>

<p>Getting my content out of Tumblr was a breeze with Jekyll&#8217;s <a href='https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/blog-migrations'>blog mirgration script</a>. I had to make a few wholesale modifications to some paths and similar things in the post files the script created but this is where Octopress imediately demonstrated it&#8217;s advantages. I was able to do regex find and replaces across 500+ posts in a few seconds using TextMate. Doing something similar to posts stored in a database would be a real pain in the ass.</p>

<h3 id='redesign'>Redesign</h3>

<p>The default Octopress theme is the most elegant default theme shipping with any CMS I&#8217;ve seen but it offers more than I need and in any case, I want a unique look for my blog. The CSS of the default theme is made to be customised and continuing the for hackers ideology its organised into <em>25</em> (yes twenty-five) <a href='http://sass-lang.com/'>Sass</a> files which compile down to one CSS file. Every feature of Sass is used, everything is modular, everything is a variable. I was hoping to reuse some of the responsive stuff but it was too complex and I ended up throwing it all out and starting again with my own CSS.</p>

<p>Logic in the template files is handled by <a href='http://liquidmarkup.org/'>Liquid</a> which made them easy to modify and generally work with.</p>

<p>When I first started out blogging with WordPress around 8 or 9 years ago I would compulsively redesign my site. Looking back this was fantastic, with every new redesign I&#8217;d learn so much. It might say something about my maturity or current state of mind that even though I&#8217;ve been using this design for over a year and moving to Octopress was an ideal opportunity to change it, I&#8217;ve kept everything the same with only some subtle updates.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d love to create some publicly available Octopress themes just as I did for WordPress and then Tumblr.</p>

<h3 id='images'>Images</h3>

<p>The only thing missing is a simple way to process images. I need something that I can easily pass through an original, have it resize to a small and a large, upload them to a server somewhere and return some Markdown pointing to the large surrounded by a link to the larger one. I&#8217;ll write a simple script to do this for me and the result will be images decoupled from my publishing system.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: I solved this problem with an <a href='http://valhallaisland.com/blog/2012/octopress-image-resizer/'>image resizing script</a>.</p>

<h3 id='conclusion'>Conclusion</h3>

<p>I&#8217;ve been using Octopress for a week now and I&#8217;ve immediately noticed the blazing speed. I don&#8217;t write much that gets big traffic but I can rest assured know that if I do it&#8217;ll no doubt handle the load with room to spare. Another great advantage is the simple ability to use proper version control for the <em>whole</em> site, both the code that generates it and the generated blog. I love the whole workflow.</p>

<p>While I&#8217;m not publishing with Tumblr anymore I still use it to read the Tumblr blogs I follow. All week I&#8217;ve been seeing <a href='http://cl.ly/3d3C3W2I0l0t1P2X3q1E'>this</a> promoted in the dashboard sidebar. It feels like I left just in time.</p>
