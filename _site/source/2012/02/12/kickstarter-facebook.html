<p>Seems to me that Kickstarter is the most important tech company since Facebook. Maybe more important in the long run.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d say <a href='http://www.kickstarter.com/'>Kickstarter</a>, a service which completely turns the table on product development, artistic endeavours, innovation and brings new meaning to the whole concept of supply and demand, is <em>definitely</em> more important than Facebook, a service which facilitates friends chatting and sharing photos.</p>

<p>What is <em>important</em> about Facebook? What&#8217;s it brought us that didn&#8217;t exist before or wouldn&#8217;t have existed otherwise? Nothing but Zynga that I can think of.</p>
