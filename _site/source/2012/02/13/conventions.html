<p>Last week&#8217;s This American Life podcast episode, a rerun from 1997, was all about <a href='http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/74/conventions'>conventions</a>. At 37:38 starts the saddest story I have ever heard, bizarrely starting at a NeXT convention and a Steve Jobs comedy roast. I&#8217;m not sure why this story hits my usually somewhat callous heart so hard but I was deeply moved.</p>
