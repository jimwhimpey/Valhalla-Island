<p>I&#8217;ve been overwhelmingly happy with <a href='http://octopress.org/'>Octopress</a> since <a href='http://valhallaisland.com/blog/2012/octopress/'>the switch</a>. There&#8217;s just one gap: image resizing and uploading. I didn&#8217;t realise how much I took this for granted with WordPress and Tumblr.</p>

<p>To fill the gap I&#8217;ve <a href='https://github.com/jimwhimpey/Blog-Image-Resizer'>written a script</a> which takes a local image path, resizes a small and large version to your specification, uploads it to a server and returns a block of HTML of the small image linking to the larger one. I used it for <a href='http://valhallaisland.com/blog/2012/microsoft-apple-web/'>this post</a> and it saved a lot of time. I also like that it decouples my image locations from my blog engine if ever I want to move again.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not pretty code and it&#8217;s been made specifically to cater for my requirements but I hope someone else can find it useful either as it is or as a base for something better.</p>
