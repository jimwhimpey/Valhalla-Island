<p>I&#8217;ve been a loyal Things user for years and I&#8217;ve been using the closed beta of Things on the Mac and iPhone for many months. From the day I downloaded the first beta it&#8217;s been as solid as a rock. It was a long time coming but Cultured Code ignored the public pressure, took the time to do it right and it&#8217;s paid off. The Things syncing experience is polished to a very high gloss.</p>
