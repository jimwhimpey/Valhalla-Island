<p>I&#8217;m definitely not a car person. I&#8217;ll go as far to say that cars are inherently flawed and even fuelled by 100% clean energy their prevalence has many negative consequences. But I digress, I wanted to write about the couple of things Tesla did right.</p>



<ol><li>It looks like a regular car. Not that the Prius is a great example of an electric car but I think they really fucked up by making it look so unlike &#8220;normal&#8221; cars. And not that I think regular cars look or function that well. I think not freaking people out with <a href="http://www.autoscraze.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Mitsubishi-i-MiEV.jpg">radically ugly</a> electric cars is a good step towards adoption.</li>

<li>The mileage the 85 kWh battery gets (480km) makes the car usable in the only scenario where cars are truly appropriate: travelling as efficiently as possible to remote places.</li>

<li>They made it regular sized. It can even carry 7 people with a special seat configuration. Like I said <a href="http://valhallaisland.com/post/16517415963">a couple of days ago</a>, a tiny car with low range that just carries one person is barely better than walking.</li>

<li>It uses a regular power outlet with the option for a higher powered specialty charger. The <a href="http://www.nissanusa.com/leaf-electric-car/index#/leaf-electric-car/video/all/LEAF_technology/charging">Leaf</a> requires a special thing installed by an electrician in your garage making impromptu charges impossible.</li>

</ol><p>I think they&#8217;ve done a lot of things right to get it widely adopted.</p>



<p>But I think they&#8217;ve gone wrong with the ridiculous number of options. There&#8217;s 54 possible combinations of model, wheel and roof. Those are only three of many other decisions you have to make. The possible combinations go into the thousands. $250 for an optional parcel shelf!? Just decide for me whether it&#8217;s a good idea, if it is, put it in and charge me for it.</p>



<p>The same goes for the battery capacities. It&#8217;s obviously the most expensive thing about the car so removing capacity reduces the cost making it more accessible but it also removes the number one advantage: long range.</p>
