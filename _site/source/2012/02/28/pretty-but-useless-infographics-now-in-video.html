<p><a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhhdmahBQU8'>This video about how acupuncture works</a> by RMIT University was <a href='http://twitter.com/makenosound/status/174286341729816576'>brought to my attention</a> this morning after I <a href='http://twitter.com/jimwhimpey/status/174283324586602496'>made a joke</a> about chiropractors.</p>

<p>Looking past the pretty veneer you can see that it&#8217;s little more than a closed captioned two minute verbal explanation. The captions are simply animated in as the words are being spoken. One concept does get visually illustrated but it&#8217;s the <em>analogy</em>. They animate cars driving on a road, why would I need <em>that</em> illustrated, I can imagine that. You have a video, why not animate what actually happens <em>to the body</em>, <em>inside</em>, where I can&#8217;t otherwise see it!?</p>

<p>I thought that it may have just been the farcical topic of acupuncture (it magically fixes the equivalent of broken down cars in your body!) that corrupted the first video. Of course it&#8217;s hard to visualise and animate something that&#8217;s inherently flawed but the <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_E4DrPRLPI'>equivalent video on interest rates</a>, a subject ripe for visual explanation, is just as bad. Simply a rudimentary verbal explanation of interest rates with fancy closed captions too.</p>

<p>These kinds of &#8220;infographics&#8221; which don&#8217;t actually disseminate information at all are <a href='http://mrgan.tumblr.com/post/509200141/infographics'>rife</a> at dumb sites like <a href='http://mashable.com/2011/09/30/twitter-history-infographic/'>Mashable</a>. It saddens me that the same concept has leaked into what should be a richer medium for explanation and that a <em>reputable university</em> is also unable to see the difference between pretty and meaningful.</p>
