<p>I was handed the old University of Queensland Cycling Club website not long after it was launched. It was <a href='http://www.joomla.org/'>Joomla</a> hell. Not only was it extremely difficult to do regular administrative stuff like <em>create pages</em> but it was very buggy and the back end was more opaque than the front. This put me in a situation where I was responsible for running the site but <em>hated</em> using it and couldn&#8217;t even take steps towards fixing it or adding anything new.</p>

<p>So I spent months recreating the whole site in WordPress and <a href='http://bbpress.org/'>bbPress</a> with a custom theme and a few custom plugins. I&#8217;m really happy with how it turned as far as design and functionality goes but most importantly it frees my club from the clutches of Joomla.</p>
