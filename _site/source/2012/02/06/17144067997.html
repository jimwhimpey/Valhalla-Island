<p>Photo replies, ask, fan mail and now <a href="http://staff.tumblr.com/post/16980189397/highlighted-posts">highlighted posts</a>. I mean, just <a href="http://static.jimwhimpey.com/images/stupid-labels.png">look at this shit</a>. The core of Tumblr has remained the same but the steady addition of gratuitous features pandering to the teenage masses participating in an online popularity contest has put me off. It was a refreshing switch from WordPress, a good 590 posts and a couple of years but Tumblr is going in a direction that is not for me.</p>



<p>When I get a chance I&#8217;ll be moving Valhalla Island to <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> or a custom system similar to <a href="http://inessential.com/2009/01/30/new_publishing_system_tour_of_my_head">Brent&#8217;s</a>. Hopefully <a href="https://github.com/markpasc/tumblrout">this tool</a> will help me smoothly transition the archive.</p>
