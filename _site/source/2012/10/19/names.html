<p>Jack Dorsey <a href='http://jacks.tumblr.com/post/33785796042/lets-reconsider-our-users'>thinks we should stop using the word &#8220;users&#8221;</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It’s time for our industry and discipline to reconsider the word “user.” We speak about “user-centric design”, “user benefit”, “user experience”, “active users”, and even “usernames.” While the intent is to consider people first, the result is a massive abstraction away from real problems people feel on a daily basis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I disagree. I have no problem with the terms &#8220;user-centric design&#8221;, &#8220;active users&#8221; or &#8220;usernames&#8221;. They&#8217;re succinct and descriptive names with no inherent prejudice. And I don&#8217;t know if the billionaire creator of <em>Twitter</em> is where we should be getting our lessons on &#8220;real problems people feel on a daily basis&#8221;.</p>

<p>Ross Floate thinks it&#8217;s <a href='http://floate.com.au/2012/10/empathy/'>a step in the right direction</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‘Users’ is a terrible term. Designers and developers employ the word ‘users’ when they’re thinking of the idiots they have to pre-empt, work around, and otherwise fix things for. ‘Users’ is a hostile label, spat out by people who don’t shave below their jawline. I’m happy to see it go.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again I disagree. There&#8217;s nothing about the word &#8220;users&#8221; which inherently implies idiot. If you think people who use your product are idiots you have to &#8220;pre-empt, work around, and otherwise fix things for&#8221; I don&#8217;t know how <em>calling them</em> something else changes anything.</p>

<p>You&#8217;re already hostile, you&#8217;re already in the wrong mindset. Just as convincing a racist stop using the N word doesn&#8217;t make them any less racist.</p>

<p>Marco Arment also <a href='http://www.marco.org/2012/10/18/jack-users'>dislikes the word</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I’ve had similar thoughts for a long time, and I also find that the term “user” is slightly disrespectful and evokes a flippant attitude from service operators.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What!? It&#8217;s hard to believe he&#8217;s talking about the word user.</p>

<p>John Gruber <a href='http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/10/18/winer-users'>brings some sense to the table</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The bottom line is how you treat them, how much respect you have for them — not what word you use to describe the people who use your product or service.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Right!</p>

<p>Dorsey quotes the dictionary definition for the word at the beginning of his post:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A person who uses or operates something, esp. a computer or other machine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To me that sounds like a damn accurate description within the context of software and product development. If you feel user is a derogatory or disrespectful name that&#8217;s nothing but your own biases and negative mindset at play.</p>
