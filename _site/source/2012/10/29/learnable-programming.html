<p>You may remember Bret Victor from his excellent <a href='http://vimeo.com/36579366'>presentation on radically transparent &#8220;live&#8221; programming IDEs</a> at CUSEC 2012.</p>

<p>Learnable Programming is half follow-up to that presentation and half response to teachers misinterpreting its message. It&#8217;s an enlightening read interspersed with short videos which perfectly illustrate his point.</p>

<p>Bret&#8217;s focus is on teaching programming but eliminating this kind of opacity present in programming environments and languages would be hugely beneficial to the most experienced software developer.</p>

<p>In the section on showing the state I didn&#8217;t immediately understand the Processing&#8217;s matrix scale and rotation states. Three seconds into the video demonstration and exactly what was happening couldn&#8217;t have been more clear. It makes me rethink everything I know about writing code.</p>
