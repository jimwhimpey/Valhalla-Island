<p>This commercial was <a href='http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/11w8s4/amazing_commercial_you_cannot_stop_watching/'>posted to Reddit</a> with the title &#8220;Amazing commercial you cannot stop watching&#8221;. I think it sucks.</p>

<p>It would be silly to uproot your life to lead an uprising against logging companies in Nicaragua, wouldn&#8217;t it!? Yeah! Well, just <em>buy these products</em> and you are absolved. Ahh, a clear and at peace conscience.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s like telling an obese person they&#8217;re never going to exercise <em>six hours a day</em>, that&#8217;s <em>crazy</em>, just eat these weight loss chocolate bars. A kind of <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man'>straw man</a> logical fallacy.</p>

<p>Quitting your job and moving to the jungle is dumb and ineffectual but buying a Mars Bar with a special logo on it shouldn&#8217;t release you of all other responsibility. A certain level of guilt is good. It forces you to be conscious of the results of your actions in all parts of your life.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t like anything that sells itself as a golden bullet to any significantly large problem. Especially when the golden bullet is <em>buying stuff</em>.</p>
