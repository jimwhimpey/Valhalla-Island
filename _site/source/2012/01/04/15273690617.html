<p>This is almost 5 years old now but was recently brought to my attention again and I want to talk about it.</p>



<p>Short version of what happened: one of the world&#8217;s greatest violinists, playing one of the world&#8217;s most intricate pieces of music on one of the world&#8217;s most expensive instruments posed as a busker in a subway for an hour and on the whole he was ignored.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m partially playing devil&#8217;s advocate as I agree with the point they&#8217;re trying to make, that people are too preoccupied with their meaningless, mundane, routine existences to experience something truly beautiful, <em>but&#8230;</em></p>



<p>It is not a surprise to me that people unlikely to be fans of classical music (because it&#8217;s not very popular in general), by definition on a schedule either to catch a train or get to work, in freezing cold temperatures, in a place designed around moving people through as quickly as possible, in a place with a lot of atmospheric noise aren&#8217;t stopping to listen to this guy.</p>



<p>Do the same &#8220;experiment&#8221; in a park on a weekend with lovely weather and I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;d gather a decent crowd.</p>
