<p>The Segway didn&#8217;t spawn a transportation revolution because what it&#8217;s trying to replace is walking, the simplest, cheapest, most convenient and most environmentally friendly transport there is. Walking is the preference. If it can be walked people want to walk it.</p>



<p>The same goes for <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-01-25/fold-up-car-unveiled-in-europe/3791794">these kinds of tiny electric cars</a> unveiled every six months or so and sold as the &#8220;answer to urban stress and pollution&#8221;.</p>



<p>A better (i.e. smaller, electricity powered) car is not the solution to transportation and social problems in urban centres which have been designed around the car but don&#8217;t need them.</p>



<p>These cars barely carry two people, never luggage and they only have a range of around 100km (which actually means a range of 50km if you want to get home). There&#8217;s much better ways to transport a single person that kind of distance with no luggage through a city. They feel like steps towards the future imagined in Wall-E:</p>

<p>We&#8217;re so car dependant/absorbed that we can&#8217;t even look away from cars as a solution to our car problem. It reminds me of that Henry Ford quote (possibly joke?): &#8220;If I&#8217;d asked my customers what they wanted, they&#8217;d have said a faster horse.&#8221; There are a lot of problems with cars in cities, just as there were with horses 100 years ago and everyone thinks the solution is a faster horse.</p>
