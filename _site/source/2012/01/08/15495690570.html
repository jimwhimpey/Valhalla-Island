<ol><li>Every transaction I make gets entered into <a href="http://quicken.intuit.com/personal-finance-software/mac-personal-financial-software.jsp">Quicken Essentials</a> with meta data. If it&#8217;s an online transaction I do it immediately. If it&#8217;s away from the computer I keep the receipt and enter it when I get home.</li>

<li>All recurring transactions including regular bills and my salary are stored in Quicken and fall into view automatically as the date arrives.</li>

<li>Each week or two I login to my bank account or credit card website and reconcile the transactions. Confirming there&#8217;s no anomalies between how much money I think I should have and how much I actually have.</li>

</ol><p>There&#8217;s a number of advantages to my approach:</p>



<ul><li>At any time, without logging into any websites I know my complete financial situation across all my accounts and cards.</li>

<li>I have descriptive and consistent meta data which if you&#8217;ve ever looked back at the cryptic list of transactions in your bank statement you know is valuable.</li>

<li>I can use the meta data as criteria in live reports like how much cash I withdraw at ATMs, spending on alcohol, bike stuff or more boringly, to help me complete my tax requirements.</li>

<li>I always know what my balance is going to be in the near future plus income and minus bills.</li>

<li>&#8220;Doing my finances&#8221; is never a chore. It takes a few seconds to enter each transaction as they happen and only a few minutes to reconcile each week or so.</li>

</ul><p>I also think there&#8217;s a less tangible benefit of &#8220;dealing with&#8221; every transaction I make. Without looking back through the history I always feel like I&#8217;m across where my money is going and even if I&#8217;m going through a period of spending a lot, it never feels out of control.</p>



<p>My financial situation is purposefully simple and this may not work for everyone but it works very well for me.</p>



<h3>Side Note</h3>



<p>Quicken Essentials is a bit rough around the edges. I&#8217;d love to switch to <a href="http://www.fadingred.com/koku/">Koku</a> but it&#8217;s missing scheduled and recurring transactions, an important requirement.</p>
