<p>The format for this post has been shamelessly stolen from <a href='http://kottke.org/about/'>Jason Kottke&#8217;s about page</a> at his venerable weblog, Kottke.org.</p>

<p><strong>2011</strong>: Fell head over heels in love with Anne. Moved into my own place. Rode and raced my bike a lot. Had problems with Anne resulting in a break up which, looking back, was a mistake. Wallowed in inner turmoil.</p>

<p><strong>2010</strong>: I go through the motions for six months: riding my bike, spending almost all I earn on inconsequential things. I break up with Kristin. My Mum runs a disastrous campaign for parliament in the federal election. I win some B grade bike races, start racing A grade, get stronger and win most improved of the year. My bike accident claim settles, I wonder what to do with the money.</p>

<p><strong>2009</strong>: I get a great full time job as a web developer at the national broadcaster. With more money than I&#8217;ve ever had in my life I move out of home in the suburbs and into an inner-city suburb flat with Kristin. I become vegetarian. I get hit by a car while training on my bike, break 20 bones including multiple vertebrae. Recovery is slow and steady but I return to the bike stronger than before.</p>

<p><strong>2008</strong>: To make up for the time lost while in Canada and to finish my degree in 3 years I take a maximum course load. All my time is spent studying. University still fails to impress me. I meet and fall for Kristin. I graduate with above average but not spectacular grades. I take up triathlon and sell my car.</p>

<p><strong>2007</strong>: Student exchange in Calgary, Canada. It&#8217;s paid for by a scholarship. I make a lot of amazing friends who remain friends years later. I love the game of hockey. Every day is a joy.</p>

<p><strong>2006</strong>: I study internet computing at university. The first year is underwhelming.</p>

<p><strong>2005</strong>: I get my first semi-serious girlfriend, we&#8217;re together for a year before breaking up in flames. I graduate high school and get accepted into university.</p>

<p><strong>2004</strong>: Half of my classes are computer related. Two of them are taught by a great teacher whose wife I end up working for during university and who I end up calling a friend.</p>

<p><strong>2003</strong>: I get my first job at an auto products chain. It&#8217;s not horrible, I earn some money, every cent of which I spend on fleeting pleasures.</p>

<p><strong>2002</strong>: Mum relents, I move to the local high school, love school and love life again.</p>

<p><strong>2001</strong>: Mum sent me to a private school 50 minutes by train from home. I didn&#8217;t know anyone and hated it. The few friends I did make lived so far away I rarely saw them outside of school.</p>

<p><strong>1999–2000</strong>: Grades 6 and 7. Started learning about computers and the internet from my computer obsessed grade 7 teacher.</p>

<p><strong>1998</strong>: Around this time my parents separated and later divorced. Both parents move into units, I made a lot of friends at both places and had a great time. Not sad or emotionally scarred.</p>

<p><strong>1994–1997</strong>: Grades 1-4 of primary school. It becomes clear I&#8217;m not a dunce but nor am I a child genius. I enjoy reading and take up playing soccer at the local club.</p>

<p><strong>1993</strong>: Preschool. Making buildings out of blocks, looking after the preschool&#8217;s rabbit.</p>

<p><strong>1992</strong>: Kindergarten. Loving life.</p>

<p><strong>1991</strong>: Hanging out with my baby sister. Playing with our two dogs. Both of which are <em>shot</em> (with a gun) in our backyard. Both survive. One is killed by a car not long later. The other leads a long, healthy life.</p>

<p><strong>1990</strong>: My sister is born.</p>

<p><strong>1988–1989</strong>: Being a baby in our suburban home.</p>

<p><strong>1987</strong>: Hello world. Born at the beginning of a Brisbane Summer.</p>
