<p>I was talking with a friend yesterday about sentimentality. She told me about a Journey concert t-shirt she&#8217;s kept from years ago because it reminds her of a fun night so she keeps it. I don&#8217;t share this mindset at all and it reminded my of a <a href='http://www.bigcontrarian.com/2010/07/06/pictures/'>great post by Jack Shedd almost three years ago</a> about photographs:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don’t want to stare at some photo of me at 21 when I’m 50 and contemplate everything I was, or could have been. I don’t want to have to drown in partial truths, grasping at a falling memory to paint in details. I’d rather either remember, or not. Rather know, or forget.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is how I feel.</p>

<p>There is no value in reminding yourself of something you would have otherwise naturally forgot if not for an artifact you&#8217;ve kept for that purpose alone. The truly defining moments of your life you will remember; photographs, t-shirts or not.</p>
