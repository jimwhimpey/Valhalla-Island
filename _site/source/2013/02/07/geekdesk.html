<p>Not being one for in depth research I went to The Wirecutter&#8217;s <a href='http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-standing-desks/'>standing desk recommendations</a>. Unfortunately everything they reviewed and recommended were far too small for my tast. <a href='http://www.geekdesk.com/'>The GeekDesk</a> came in multiple large sizes and looked great. I bought it.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been using it for over a month now and love it.</p>

<p>As expected standing is great for about 30-45 minutes after which I&#8217;m happy to be able to drop it back down to sitting.</p>

<p>I like it so much I switched to a standing desk at work. Work&#8217;s standing desks aren&#8217;t dynamically adjustable. They&#8217;re set to a specific height perfect for standing and come with a high stool. It&#8217;s good but the GeekDesk&#8217;s ability to switch between a normal seated position and standing is far superior.</p>

<p>An unexpected but huge benefit of the GeekDesk&#8217;s fine grained height controls is that this is the first time ever I&#8217;ve had a desk at the perfect height in the <em>seated</em> position. Even if I never stood it would be worth it for that alone.</p>

<p>It was easy to put together, feels very sturdy, is finished nicely and the height presets make it simple to operate. Without the height presets it&#8217;d be very frustrating to operate. Switching between sitting and standing takes one button press and around 15 seconds.</p>

<p>Highly recommended.</p>
