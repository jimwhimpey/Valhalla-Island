<p>Meg Jay makes a great case for not wasting your 20s.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve seen a lot of 20s in an endless cycle of aimlessly traveling, working terrible jobs, living with their parents and generally fucking around. Often the travel is in the name of self discovery and development the with terrible jobs and staying at home in support of that. But it&#8217;s not self discovery, so often it&#8217;s no more than getting drunk and high with the same type of person in different parts of the world.</p>

<p>The opposite behavior is no better. Working every waking our in the name of career development or in the hopes of getting your startup bought may seem more responsible but are equally wasteful of such potentially fulfilling and foundation building period.</p>

<p>Friends sticking with unsatisfying and obviously not working relationships is also common. The best advice I&#8217;ve received is to not waste time dating shitheads, bite the bullet and end it. You&#8217;re not just wasting time but you&#8217;re foregoing opportunities every day.</p>

<p>The same goes for couples in great relationships who are putting off shared life goals in the name of &#8220;things they haven&#8217;t done yet&#8221;. Stop wasting time. There&#8217;s nothing you can&#8217;t do married that you could have done in a happy long term relationship.</p>
