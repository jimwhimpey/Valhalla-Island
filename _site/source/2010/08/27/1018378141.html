I must have spent almost every dollar I earnt as a teenager on those CDs. In the end I got back about 1/24th of what I originally paid retail. Dying media, eh?</p>



<p>Anyway, I&#8217;ve recently been reading Our Choice by Al Gore, a big heavy book in an almost square shape with textbook-like thick paper and a soft cover. This thing is frustratingly difficult to read and has prompted me to buy a Kindle. To finance the purchase I&#8217;m getting rid of the few books I&#8217;ve acquired over the years that I know I&#8217;ll never read again or that I can buy again as Kindle books, i.e. all of them.</p>



<p>To help my get rid of them I&#8217;ve made a website: <a href="http://jimsbooksale.heroku.com/">jimsbooksale.heroku.com</a> It&#8217;s a Sinatra app with DataMapper interfacing a PostGre database running on <a href="http://heroku.com/">Heroku</a>. The whole thing took about 10 hours from start to finish and I&#8217;m once again blown away by how easy and what a joy it is to make things with this stack.</p>



<p>Unless you live in the inner Brisbane suburbs and can pick it up it&#8217;s probably not worth your while requesting anything but if you want a number of books let me know and I can organise shipping.</p>
