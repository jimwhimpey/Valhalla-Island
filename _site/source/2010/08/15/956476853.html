<p><a href="http://www.farbeyondthestars.com/57-things/">The Less You Have, The More Epic Your Life</a></p><p>Everett Bogue owns just 57 things. After reading the list you might wonder how he brushes his teeth, washes himself or his clothes, cooks food, cleans his accommodation, where he sits, what he sleeps on, how he keeps food frozen, what he eats from or with or how he pumps up his bike tyres.</p>



<p>The answer to a lot of those questions seems to be he lives with someone and they obviously have a lot of shared items that facilitate these necessities of life. I&#8217;d say that invalidates the 57 things count but maybe, like the underwear disclaimer, it&#8217;s one of the unspoken rules of the minimalist blogger:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>I’m counting my underwear and socks together because every other minimalist blogger does too. We’re allowed to cheat on undergarments because we always have.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Irrefutable logic.</p>



<p>Pretend for a minute that he really only has 57 things in the way it&#8217;s being sold. As I&#8217;ve <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/160357037">written before</a>, simplicity not minimalism should be the goal. There is no inherent good in minimalism. Owning a toothbrush is not a burden <em>plus</em> it makes it very easy to brush my teeth when the time comes twice a day.</p>



<p>As with many things Bike Snob <a href="http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2010/08/new-smugness-keeping-it-to-minimum.html">sums it up</a> using minimal words:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>[…] at what point is the effort involved ultimately less simple than simply having the stuff?</p>
