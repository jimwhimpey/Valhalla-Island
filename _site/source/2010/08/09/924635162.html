<p>A week in the life of many I see every Saturday morning:</p>



<ol><li>Always take the lift instead of the stairs.</li>

<li>Treat escalators like rides.</li>

<li>Watch 3 hours of TV each evening.</li>

<li>Drive <em>everywhere</em>, even the shortest of distances.</li>

<li>Join a group of 10 others on Saturday morning to attend a $20, 1 hour bootcamp involving relentless, unpleasant physical activity while being yelled at by a personal trainer.</li>

<li>Suffer an injury.</li>

<li>Sore all over, spend the next five days doing nothing while you recover.</li>

<li>Associate exercise with terrible things, resent it.</li>

</ol><p>Exercise needs to be a part of life. It doesn&#8217;t work as a chore you do to top up your fitness every couple of weeks. When it is treated that way with things like boot camps the negatives it produces in the form of injuries, exhaustion for days and negative connotations with exercise totally outweigh any benefit from a one hour workout.</p>



<p>Keeping fit and healthy is simple: find a physical activity you love. For me it&#8217;s cycling, for you it could be tennis, swimming, rowing, boxing, skipping, dancing or walking though the park. The physical benefits become a side effect of something you love doing in any case.</p>
