<p>The complete artistic freedom to create <em>whatever you want</em> as a music video must be one of the greatest perks that come with being a successful musical act. Most artists squander the opportunity on bland, abstract rubbish so full of jump cuts and general over-editing they&#8217;re difficult to watch.</p>



<p>OK Go take full advantage, producing beautifully crafted and entertaining clips based on original ideas. There&#8217;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJKythlXAIY">another video</a> for the same track which couldn&#8217;t be more different for content but is equally creative and well executed. Meanwhile they&#8217;re uploading everything they do in 1080p to YouTube. In an industry where so many don&#8217;t, OK Go <em>gets it</em>.</p>
