<p>There is a high end restaurant that sits literally over the river not far from where I live. I have no idea how it got the position, there&#8217;s no other business anywhere near the bank of the river 5km in either direction. They&#8217;re quite famous in Brisbane for their location and apparently the food is pretty good, albeit expensive.</p>



<p>They recently attached a platform jetty off the main restaurant building, filled it with tables and opened it as a fish and chip shop. This pleased me because there&#8217;s no other fish and chip shop within walking distance and I liked the idea walking along the river before eating on the water.</p>



<p>I picked up a menu next time I passed, found that the cheapest item available was $15 and wrote off the idea forever.</p>



<p>It sits right on the bikeway that runs into the city and I pass this place often. From the bikeway you can see the every table on the jetty. In the three months or so it&#8217;s been open I have seen <em>one</em> person eating there.</p>



<p>One month into the opening they must have got sick of putting out and putting away a full set of tables for next to no customers so they started putting out only three tables. This meant only about 25% of the jetty was used and it looked ridiculous. Still no one ate there.</p>



<p>A month later I guess they realised how pathetic it looked to have a jetty with only three unoccupied tables and they switched back to the full compliment of unoccupied tables. Since then I still don&#8217;t see anyone eating there.</p>
