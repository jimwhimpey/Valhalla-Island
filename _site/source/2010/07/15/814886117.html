<p>So <a href="http://blogs.consumerreports.org/electronics/2010/07/apple-iphone-4-antenna-issue-iphone4-problems-dropped-calls-lab-test-confirmed-problem-issues-signal-strength-att-network-gsm.html">Consumer Reports can&#8217;t recommend the iPhone 4</a>.</p>



<p>And the iPhone 4 is <a href="http://digitaldaily.allthingsd.com/20100712/consumer-reports-by-the-way-the-iphone-4-is-also-the-best-smartphone-on-the-market/">Consumer Reports highest rated smart phone</a>.</p>



<p>I am as excited about getting Consumer Reports highest rated phone today as I was the day it was released. Why?</p>



<ol><li>On the whole, reception is <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/07/13/yes-the-iphone-4-is-broken-no-the-iphone-4-is-not-broken/">way better than previous iPhones</a>. Many are reporting if they try really hard they can reproduce the problem but in real world use they&#8217;re dropping <em>far fewer calls</em> with the iPhone 4 (I should stop right here, it&#8217;s all that matters).</li>

<li>The &#8220;problem&#8221; is 100% solved with a case or <a href="http://www.marco.org/733115343">small piece of tape</a> (and that&#8217;s probably a much bigger piece than what&#8217;s actually required).</li>

<li>It&#8217;s Consumer Reports <em>highest rated phone</em>. Higher even than Consumer Reports second highest rated phone, the iPhone 3GS, a phone with no reception issue hysteria.</li>

</ol><p>Then there&#8217;s the flakey proximity sensor issue the likes of which <a href="http://log.maniacalrage.net/post/763449236/update-on-iphone-4-issues-part-ii">Garrett Murray is experiencing</a>.</p>



<p>What a fantastic reason to use the hands free headphones and not hold a microwave transmitter next to your brain. Even if the <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2010/05/17/2901641.htm">link isn&#8217;t clear</a> it&#8217;s not worth the risk.</p>



<p>The only thing that frustrates me about these issues is that it&#8217;s obviously delaying the iPhone 4&#8217;s release in Australia.</p>



<p>It&#8217;ll be interesting to see what Apple announces at its <a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2010/07/14/apple-to-hold-special-iphone-4-press-conference-on-friday/">Friday press conference</a>.</p>
