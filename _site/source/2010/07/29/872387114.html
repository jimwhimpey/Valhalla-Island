<p>Curious details from the Safari 5.0.1 release notes:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Fixes an issue that could cause borders on YouTube thumbnails to disappear when hovering over the thumbnail image</p>

  

  <p>Fixes an issue that could cause Flash content to overlap with other content on <a href="http://www.facebook.com">www.facebook.com</a>, <a href="http://www.crateandbarrel.com">www.crateandbarrel.com</a>, and other sites when using Flash 10.1</p>
