<blockquote>I don’t want to stare at some photo of me at 21 when I’m 50 and contemplate everything I was, or could have been. I don’t want to have to drown in partial truths, grasping at a falling memory to paint in details. I’d rather either remember, or not.</blockquote>I couldn&#8217;t agree more with <a href="http://www.bigcontrarian.com/2010/07/06/pictures/">Jack Shedd about photographs</a>.
