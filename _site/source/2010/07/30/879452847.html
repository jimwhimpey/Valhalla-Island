<p>From Adam Quigley&#8217;s <a href="http://www.alwayswatching.net/features/lost-sucks">fantastic, detailed look back</a> on six years of Lost after seeing the final episode:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>&#8220;Across the Sea&#8221;, the Jacob/Man in Black flashback episode, is the break-up.</p>

  

  <p>For some, I suspect the series finale was the make-up sex.</p>

  

  <p>For me, the series finale was like being forced to watch my six-year lover blow another guy.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>For me it was make up sex followed by an empty feeling a couple of days after I&#8217;d realised what I&#8217;d done. Nonetheless, a bad breakup doesn&#8217;t nullify 6 years of good times.</p>
