Funnily enough, the experience is much worse <em>with</em> Flash installed. Browsing high end suits online is frustrating to say the least. You&#8217;re contending with extremely Flash heavy sites that take forever to load navigation schemes I cannot comprehend.</p>



<p>When you&#8217;re selling $1500+ outfits where brand is everything you&#8217;d think you&#8217;d be able to get a website made that isn&#8217;t a piece of shit. Give me a few suits, a month or two and I&#8217;ll fucking do it.</p>



<p>Meanwhile the sites selling rip offs like <a href="http://www.italiancart.com/">Italian Cart</a> are doing a much better job.</p>
