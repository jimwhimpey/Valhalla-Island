  <p>Whereas what they should be doing for the mac is testing is Flash available. If it is, give them Flash, if it&#8217;s not give them the same HTML5 video that we&#8217;re giving to the iPad.</p>

<p>John Gruber in <a href="http://5by5.tv/talkshow/16">episode 16 of The Talk Show</a> on getting HTML5 video instead of Flash by spoofing your browser&#8217;s user agent string.</p>



<p>I disagree with Gruber here. Web developers shouldn&#8217;t be testing for the presence of Flash, they should be testing for the presence of HTML5 video support. If the browser supports <code>&lt;video&gt;</code>, serve them <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> whether they have Flash installed or not. It&#8217;s a better experience.</p>
