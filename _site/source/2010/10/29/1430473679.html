<p>As a cyclist who races regularly and who&#8217;s been in major and minor accidents whenever I&#8217;m out on the bike I&#8217;m hyper aware of what&#8217;s happening around me. This transfers to all areas of my life. Despite not owning a car for a couple of years I&#8217;m a much better driver now than I was when I drove daily. I notice things in and appreciate my immediate environment.</p>



<p>When I saw Frank Chimero&#8217;s <a href="http://blog.frankchimero.com/post/1374646378/the-being-there-diary">being there diary</a> idea I wondered, why do people find this so hard?</p>



<p>Not all that long ago it seemed to only be those listening to music, fucking with their phones or reading books (!) who were oblivious to the world around them. Now it&#8217;s even those not using any sort of sensory noise maker that fail to notice they&#8217;re about to walk directly into me.</p>



<p>I consider it profoundly rude to purposefully shut yourself off from the world with something like headphones in almost any public situation but seeing people walk around like zombies <em>anyway</em> just makes me sad.</p>
