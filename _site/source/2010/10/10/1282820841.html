<p>Through a friend I heard about <a href="http://www.theapplebrisbane.com.au/">The Apple apartments</a>, a new building being built in the city full of one bedrooms for a reasonable price. My idea of an <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/271313749">ideal home</a> has always been one bedroom (ish), although a house rather an apartment but that&#8217;s unrealistic as close as I want to be to the city.</p>



<p>Perhaps being in the market for something like this in the near future I naturally looked them up online. The main thing I was looking for was a completion date, instead I get:</p>



<ul><li>An unskippable Flash splash page.</li>

<li>A video of the same model doing various activities in different outfits cut between stock footage of Brisbane.</li>

<li>Flash slideshows of the same model doing more various things.</li>

<li>Meaningless marketing gobbledegook such as:

<blockquote style="margin-top: 10px;">We have a new world city view on life. The world is now full of fast energy with intelligent phones, wireless internet, casual working hours and a commitment to being kind to the environment.</blockquote></li>

<li>Information embedded in PDFs displayed using an insane Flash app with an excruciatingly slow page turn animation and <em>sound effects</em>.</li>

<li>A 56 page brochure made up almost entirely of full page photographs of the same model doing various activities, stock images and random photos of the city with text overlays saying things like “make a difference” and “it’s all yours”.</li>

</ul><p>When I was told simply what they were, one bedroom apartments, priced well and in a great location, I was very interested.  When I find try to find out more from their official marketing I&#8217;m thoroughly put off the entire thing.</p>



<p>Just like when I find myself being swayed by a well done advertising campaign that focuses on anything but product I remind myself that the marketing department and the product department are disconnected parties. In many cases the marketing department probably isn&#8217;t even part of the company. A good advertising campaign doesn&#8217;t mean a good product.</p>



<p>It works both ways, The Apple Apartments terrible marketing material doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean the product is terrible but it sure makes it difficult.</p>
