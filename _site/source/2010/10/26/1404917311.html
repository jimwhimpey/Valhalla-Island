<blockquote>For a lot of people who grew up in the &#8217;80s and &#8217;90s, cassettes hold a nostalgic appeal that outstrips their inferior sound quality.</blockquote><p><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/10/25/3047591.htm">Tape lovers mix it up, old-spool</a></p>



<p>Translation: a lot of people are holding onto inferior garbage in spite of qualities that actually matter in order to score cool points with equally dumb and irrational people.</p>
