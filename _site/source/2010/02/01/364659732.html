<p>Without having seen either screen I&#8217;m guessing the Kindle is much better for reading books. Better reading comfort and incredibly long battery life are the Kindle advantage.</p>



<p>Is that advantage plus the $230 you&#8217;ll save forfeiting an iPad purchase worth everything else the iPad offers including a book reader and Kindle app? If you don&#8217;t have an iPhone then I think the answer is no. If you do (who doesn&#8217;t), I think the answer is&#8230; how much do you read?</p>



<p>Is it realistic to own both? And an iPhone? I don&#8217;t think so.</p>



<p>It doesn&#8217;t look great for the Kindle. The thing that bothers me about the Kindle is that the $270 outlay gets you a device that&#8217;s pretty much useless until you spend more money at the same place, the only place you can buy books, Amazon.</p>

  <p>I think Amazon is in the content business first, the device business second. A world where Kindle hardware sales pale in comparison to the iPad but where thereâ€™s a very popular Kindle app for iPad that competes against iBooks is not a bad situation for Amazon.</p>

<p>I agree but what reason does anyone have to buy books from Amazon over Apple&#8217;s (presumably) better integrated, more convenient (if only slightly) system? The more Kindle&#8217;s in people&#8217;s hands the more reason to buy content from Amazon, for both devices.</p>



<p>Amazon should sell the Kindle <em>cheap</em>. Cost or below. Sell it on its merits: simply the best book reading experience. Make money on what they always have, books, which can be read across devices including the iPad. Amazon&#8217;s history and success is in selling books, sell more Kindles, sell more books. The more Kindles the more reason there is to buy from Amazon.</p>
