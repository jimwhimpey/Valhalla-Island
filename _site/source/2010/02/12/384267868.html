<p>I&#8217;ve experienced this first hand on two screenshots I posted to Flickr over three years ago. One of the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jimwhimpey/294080383/">Facebook login screen</a> and the equivalent at <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jimwhimpey/294080639/">MySpace</a>. I think at the time it was for a blog post comparing the two. They have remained the two most viewed images on my Flickr account over four years <em>by far</em>. Each have a number of comments like these:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>I love to talk and chat with people I do or do not know I am kind and hard working.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>and</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Hey ppl how is everyone doing me im fine im new here need to meet ppl.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>None of these people have any photos attached to their accounts, it appears they&#8217;ve got to that page, created a Flickr account and commented before (if ever) realising that this screenshot isn&#8217;t actually Facebook or Myspace. It&#8217;s mind blowing.</p>
