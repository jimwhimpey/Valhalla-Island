<blockquote>The publisher of Australia&#8217;s white and yellow pages, Sensis, has just received greenhouse friendly certification from the Federal Government and plans to reduce its carbon footprint by 5%.</blockquote><p><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/02/04/2810301.htm?site=thedrum">Sensis goes carbon neutral, but phone books here to stay</a></p>



<p>To get greenhouse friendly certification from the government just print millions of 3000 page phone books and litter them across the country. Sensis are literally manufacturing <em>rubbish</em>. The Australian government&#8217;s stance on the environment is a joke.</p>
