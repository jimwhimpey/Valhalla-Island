<p><a href="http://staff.tumblr.com/post/394917564/auto-reblog-as-link">Automatically posting huge reblogs as links</a> is the most positive and useful feature Tumblr has implemented in a long time. Although 500 words isn&#8217;t a small enough limit. Duplicating content in full undermines the hyperlinks the internet is built on besides being plain <em>unethical</em>.</p>



<p>It comes after a string of strange feature additions like <a href="http://staff.tumblr.com/post/378956398/photo-replies">photo replies</a> and <a href="http://staff.tumblr.com/post/320191537/ask">ask a question</a> which seem to be pushing Tumblr in a different, social network like (cringe) direction.</p>



<p>Meanwhile the largest reliable width photo you can use in your themes is only 500 pixels wide. There&#8217;s <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/custom_themes#photo-posts">four other options</a>, all <em>smaller</em> than 500 pixel. There&#8217;s a high res option that could be any size at any aspect ratio and if your image is below a certain threshold nothing will show at all..</p>



<p>I can ask a user a question natively within Tumblr (isn&#8217;t email for this?)  but it&#8217;s impossible to reliably display photos larger than 500 pixels wide in my theme.</p>
