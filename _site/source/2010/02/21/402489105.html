</ul><p>What I get from Channel 9&#8217;s Winter Olympics coverage:</p>



<ul><li>Interviews with Australian athletes by patronising hosts who belittle their profession by asking questions about the rules, how scary it must be and how cold snow is.</li>

<li>Analysis of events by panelists with little knowledge or even interest in Winter sports mostly spent marvelling at the scenery.</li>

<li>Special reports on the shopping and eating to be had in downtown Vancouver.</li>

<li>Long winded interviews with the people behind the opening ceremonies.</li>

<li>Special reports on the nightlife in Whistler.</li>

</ul>
