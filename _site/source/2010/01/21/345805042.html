<p>Having recently <em>invested</em> in a Nikon D90 and being in the middle of a small holiday there&#8217;s a thick stream of photos dropping into the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jimwhimpey/">Flickr account</a> I&#8217;ve paid for and used on and off for almost 5 years.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s a lot to love about Flickr but again the antiquated 5 year old design and slow navigation is frustrating me. I upload huge files out of Aperture yet there&#8217;s <em>no way</em> to directly browse between photos at anything larger than 500px wide. Even that is an excruciatingly slow process with a full, heavy page reload required for each image.</p>



<p>Facebook, who don&#8217;t even store high resolution versions of images, have a much larger default browsing size and lighting fast navigation via keyboard and mouse.</p>



<p><a href="http://ihardlyknowher.com/">I Hardly Know Her</a> tries to address the issues but falls short with no way to force set views to show a larger size by default and omitting the title and caption, even from the meta data shown on mouse over. I&#8217;m all for the hiding by default but why omit the title and caption while including stuff like the aperture and shutter speed? Technical details few care about and remain a click away for those that do.</p>
