<p>Until recently the only thing Flash has ever been good for is video playback online. HTML5&#8217;s introduction of the &lt;video&gt; element and browser&#8217;s support for it is rendering Flash totally obsolete to the joy of everyone outside Adobe.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve been using <a href="http://rentzsch.github.com/clicktoflash/">ClickToFlash</a> to serve me H264 video via &lt;video&gt; at YouTube for a while now. The experience is simply better. I&#8217;ve <em>never</em> used a custom Flash video player that didn&#8217;t suck and that&#8217;s excluding the way Flash churns through processor speed often kicking the fans into maximum RPM.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s fantastic to see <a href="http://youtube-global.blogspot.com/2010/01/introducing-youtube-html5-supported.html">YouTube</a> and <a href="http://www.Vimeo.com/blog:268">Vimeo</a> both offering official (albeit testing) means to use HTML5 &lt;video&gt; over their Flash players. Before long I&#8217;ll be able to replace ClickToFlash with an uninstall of Flash Player altogether.</p>
