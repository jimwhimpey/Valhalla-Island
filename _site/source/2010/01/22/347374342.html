<p><a href="http://clientsfromhell.tumblr.com/">Clients From Hell</a> was one of those blogs that started out so great I read back through every post from their relatively short archive.</p>



<p>But since experiencing the sweet high of tumblarity Clients From Hell has succumbed to the post-as-much-as-you-can-regardless-of-quality trap that the Tumblr ecosystem fosters. Now it&#8217;s less <em>clients from hell</em>, more <em>clients that are a little dumb</em>, which is entertaining in itself but in a funniest home videos rather than stand up comedian way.</p>
