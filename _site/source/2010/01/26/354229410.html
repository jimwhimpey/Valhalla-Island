Ignoring the ridiculous &#8220;We live in your world&#8221; (which I bet sounded <em>great</em> to some ANZ executive in their marketing boardroom), <em>how</em> are ANZ making banking simpler? How can banking be any simpler? It&#8217;s a safe place to store your money, you gain modest interest on the account, you withdraw and pay for things from the account, you pay some fees for the convenience. <em>That&#8217;s it</em>. The explanation of banking as far as customers are concerned is not much longer than the billboard telling us how <em>simple</em> ANZ is making it.</p>



<p>For some reason this billboard reminds me of all those wireless broadband commercials that advertise a <strong>huge</strong> 2GB or a <strong>massive</strong> 500MB of data each month. How are they legally even able to describe it as that?</p>
