<p>There were <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/717434547">four new features</a> I was looking forward to in iOS. Unfortunately the iPhone 3G only gets two of them.</p>



<p>The 3G doesn&#8217;t have the power to support multi-tasking so the fast app switching widget isn&#8217;t included, unfortunately the iPhone orientation lock is part of the fast app switching widget and also excluded. Bluetooth keyboard support just isn&#8217;t there.</p>



<p>Worse than the missing features I was most looking forward to is the slow down of the system in general. This release has obviously erred on the side of providing a better experience to the more powerful 3GS and 4.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s one feature of one application which has particularly suffered. Unfortunately it&#8217;s my favourite feature of my most used iPhone application: tilt scrolling in <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a>. Under iOS 4 it&#8217;s severely jaggy with none of the fine control available under iPhone OS 3.</p>



<p>With any luck it won&#8217;t be too long until iPhone 4 is brought to Australia and I can retire my ageing iPhone 3G.</p>
