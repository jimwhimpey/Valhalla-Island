<blockquote>

  <p>Because if you&#8217;re honest, no matter where you stand, no matter your politics, religion, income or mode of transport, you see this beast of creeping death and you understand: That is us. The spill may be many things, <strong>but more than anything else it is a giant, horrifying mirror</strong>.</p>

  

  <p>[&#8230;]</p>

  

  <p>As if oil wasn&#8217;t woven like oxygen into every single aspect of American life, as if fully 30 percent of domestic transportation fuel didn&#8217;t come from the gulf, as if shutting down a fraction of those wells wouldn&#8217;t re-devastate the economy, as if petroleum and coal weren&#8217;t powering the very energy plants that deliver the electricity that charges the iPhones that allows everyone to Tweet their angry complaints through all the various energy-sucking server farms the size of a small country.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>I&#8217;ve made a few life decisions with the goal of reducing my personal fossil fuel dependance: sold my car, stopped eating meat but it&#8217;s not enough. Even buying food from the supermarket who have things delivered by thousands of trucks, ships and air planes is participating in the destructive economy of oil dependance.</p>



<p>This man made disaster has affected me deeply and I have to do more if only personally and for my own conscience. Step one has to be owning my own home.</p>
