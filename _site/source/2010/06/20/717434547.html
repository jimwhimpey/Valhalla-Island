<p>My iPhone 3G is starting to show its age. The home button is hard to press properly and there&#8217;s some scuffs on the screen but mostly the software, especially third party software, feels slow.</p>



<p>Luckily my iPhone 3G contract ends in August so I&#8217;ll be able to pick up the iPhone 4 not too long after it&#8217;s released without having to pay any more than I do now. Besides a massive speed jump (same processor as the iPad but <em>double</em> the RAM!) iPhone 4 will unlock a few iOS features not available to older iPhones. Here&#8217;s the new features I&#8217;m most looking forward to:</p>



<ul><li>Spell check. Often on the iPhone I&#8217;ll find myself guessing letters, deleting and guessing again until the autocomplete kicks in to spell a word I don&#8217;t know how to spell. A real spell checker is better.</li>

<li>Blue tooth keyboard support. This is <em>awesome</em>. I used to use <a href="http://mirasoftware.com/BPE2/">BluePhoneElite</a> to send text messages through my phone from my computer. Typing out even an average length message on an iPhone sucks when you&#8217;ve got a keyboard in front of you. I&#8217;m interested to see how this will work with a Bluetooth keyboard already paired with a computer, ideally there&#8217;d be a switch to flip pairing.</li>

<li>Screen orientation lock. It doesn&#8217;t bother me that it&#8217;s only a software switch because I&#8217;ll turn it on and never turn it off again.</li>

<li>All in one Mail inbox. Long overdue.</li>

</ul><p>Judging by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/scobleizer/4695267529/sizes/o/">this</a> it looks like one of my top three iPhone activities — reading Instapaper articles — is going to be vastly improved. I can&#8217;t wait to actually see it.</p>
