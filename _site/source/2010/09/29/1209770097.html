<p>Specifically the radar, recommended blogs and Tumblr Tuesday modules with options to hide only those you want hidden.</p>

<p>I made this to scratch my own itch. The radar annoys me because 90% of the time it&#8217;s the same (literally, the turnover is really low) crap. Recommended blogs annoys me because the recommendations are bad. Tumblr Tuesday annoys me because it&#8217;s set to show on US time which is Wednesday my time and I don&#8217;t follow any blogs which fall into the categories it defines. They&#8217;re all distractions I could do without. The radar and recommended blogs have hide toggles but they very quickly forget about being hidden and I&#8217;ve gotten sick of clicking the hide button.</p>
