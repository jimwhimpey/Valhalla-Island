<p><a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/596483252">Yesterday&#8217;s post</a> on Flash&#8217;s claims of openness was linked to on <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/05/14/whimpey">Daring Fireball</a> (and later <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/05/14/flash-developer-tools">followed up</a>) and resulted in <em>a lot</em> of emails telling me how wrong I am.</p>



<p>Admittedly, I was wrong and posted an amendment. In Gruber&#8217;s followup he wrote:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>I still say Whimpey’s conclusion stands — it’s not the tools that make Flash a closed platform, it’s that the runtime, Flash Player, is completely controlled and defined by Adobe. Adobe’s argument is that Flash is an open part of the web but that there just happens to exist only one implementation, their own closed-source Flash Player.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Adobe has published the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/swf/">SWF file format specification</a> which theoretically allows anyone to build authoring tools <em>and</em> interpreters for Flash content. In practice the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gnash/">number one open source Flash player</a> (or at least the only one with any presence online) barely supports anything. From the gnash website:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>[&#8230;] and supports most SWF v7 features and some SWF v8 and v9</p>

</blockquote>



<p>SWF is currently at version 10. The page <a href="http://www.flashmagazine.com/news/detail/open_source_and_free_development_tools_for_flash/">proudly listing</a> open source and free development tools has a section on players:</p>



<blockquote>While the specs for creating SWF files are <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/swf/">freely available</a>, it&#8217;s not currently possible to create fully featured Flash Players as Open Source. The main reason is that Adobe&#8217;s implementation of the Flash Player makes use of <a href="http://www.adobe.com/de/products/eula/third_party/flashplayer/">technology licensed from several companies</a>.</blockquote>



<p>So my original point stands:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Adobe: not open, claim to be.</p>

  

  <p>Apple: not open, don’t claim to be, contribute heavily to that which is truly open.</p>

</blockquote>
