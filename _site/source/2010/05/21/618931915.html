<p>The mainstream media has recently picked up on what the internet media has been complaining about for years: Facebook has a lot of information about you which it can use almost however it wants. Complaining about this baffles me.</p>



<p>Facebook is not mandatory and nor is it a right. There&#8217;s a simple way to completely eliminate the risk of Facebook exploiting your data: don&#8217;t give it your data. If you like Facebook and find utility in what it offers the risk might be worth the reward.</p>



<p>End of story.</p>
