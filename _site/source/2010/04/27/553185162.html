<p>I agree with Julio Ody in that <a href="http://julio-ody.tumblr.com/post/552745613/why-tony-stark-is-better-than-you">design competency is hugely advantageous</a> for developers but disagree on the tools he first suggests:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Stop believing Photoshop, Pixelmator, Illustrator, or anything else is too hard.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>They <em>are</em> too hard, too inefficient, too poorly suited to designing web UIs, too expensive and simply unnecessary. It&#8217;s followed by much better advice:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Still donâ€™t want to fork the cash for these suites, or you consider yourself really incapable of learning any of them? Design straight in HTML and CSS.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Anything you can&#8217;t do in HTML and CSS is more design than any developer should be concerning themselves with. Besides, it&#8217;s faster, less fiddly, more precise, easily scriptable, repeatable, you&#8217;ll always have real content to work with and obviously, it&#8217;ll always look exactly like the end result. Starting your design in HTML and CSS (or better, HAML and SASS) is simply better.</p>



<p><a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com">This blog</a>, <a href="http://getcampusnotes.com/">Campus Notes</a>, <a href="http://solidbase.tumblr.com/">A Solid Base</a> and <a href="http://darkroom.heroku.com/">Darkroom</a> were all designed with minimal or (more commonly) no contact at all with a graphics editor. While none of them are visually stunning, that&#8217;s not the goal. The goal is not letting <em>poor</em> design get in the way and not having to rely on a designer to prevent it.</p>



<p>Three years ago I wrote <a href="http://archive.valhallaisland.com/blog/2007/simple-ways-to-help-your-design-suck-less-1/">a post about simple things you can do to help your design suck less</a>. All of my suggestions still stand today and can be implemented more efficiently without thousands of dollars worth of bloated design software.</p>
