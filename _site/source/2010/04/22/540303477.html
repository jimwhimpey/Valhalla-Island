<p>The car rather than <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/540208616">the website</a> this time. Starting with the facts:</p>



<ul><li>It gets 100 miles per charge.</li>

<li>Charging requires a home installed charging station.</li>

</ul><p>The site fails to mention how long it takes to recharge which makes me assume it comes no where near rivalling a 10 minute petrol fill up. I&#8217;m guessing it requires an overnight charge. So even if there were public recharge stations and you want to be able to get home, the leaf&#8217;s effective range is 50 miles.</p>



<p>There is one scenario to which cars are perfectly suited: long distance travel to remote locations. Places to which operating public transport is not and will never be feasible or sensible. Short range electric cars like the Leaf are competitors to public transport, car sharing schemes, walking and bicycling within cities.</p>



<p>Cars in cities, electric or otherwise, are the problem. If you live in a sufficiently densely populated area where any conceivable destination is within 50 miles public transport is feasible and should be the solution.</p>



<p>It reminds me of &#8220;urban transport devices&#8221; like the Segway and the <a href="http://www.yikebike.com/">YikeBike</a>. They&#8217;re competing with <em>walking</em> and riding a bike. There&#8217;s no problem they&#8217;re solving.</p>
