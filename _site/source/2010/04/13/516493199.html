<p>With two significant changes:</p>



<ol><li>It&#8217;s now totally free for everyone.</li>

<li>We&#8217;ve exposed <a href="http://getcampusnotes.com/api">our API</a>.</li>

</ol><p>It&#8217;s free in the hope of building a user base. The API uses secure OAuth authentication and makes every read/write method available to developers. The API documentation isn&#8217;t yet complete but there&#8217;s enough to get you started.</p>



<p>The entire front end has been redesigned, including <a href="http://getcampusnotes.com/jimwhimpey/214-welcome">shared notes</a> and there&#8217;s a few nice new features in the back end like the ability to inline embed attached images.</p>
