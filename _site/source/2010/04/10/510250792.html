<blockquote>Mac OS X 10.7 development continues, but with a reduced team and an unknown schedule. Itâ€™s my educated guess that there will be no 10.7 news at WWDC this year, and probably none until WWDC 2011.</blockquote><p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/2010/04/reading_between_the_iphone_os_4_lines">John Gruber</a> in a post on iPhone OS 4.0.</p>



<p>This saddens me. I love the iPhone and assume I&#8217;ll love the iPad but they are great almost only for consuming. The market of consumers is obviously much larger than that of creators but it&#8217;s a shame development of the consumer&#8217;s device and software has to come at the expense of the creator&#8217;s.</p>
