<p>Before I got my <a href="https://buy.garmin.com/shop/shop.do?pID=10885">Garmin Edge 705</a> I was using the iPhone + <a href="http://runkeeper.com/">RunKeeper</a> combo. RunKeeper was for simply tracking the distances I was riding before I had a bike computer rather than for any kind of analysis. I get much more data out of the Garmin and it&#8217;s lead me head first into a category of software I hadn&#8217;t previously explored.</p>



<p>The options are numerous both online and client side but each have their own sets of positives, negatives and quirks. I&#8217;ll attempt to summarise my findings over the last week.</p>



<h3><a href="http://runkeeper.com/">RunKeeper</a></h3>



<p>The website presents the relatively small amount of data RunKeeper collects well. Every other app here has features that stretch beyond what RunKeeper&#8217;s can provide. If all you have is an iPhone this is without a doubt the way to go.</p>



<p><strong>Positives</strong></p>



<ul><li>Great graph and map integration. Hover over the graph and it shows you the point on the map.</li>

<li>Great looking, readable graphs.</li>

<li>Good presentation of summary data like total distance, average speed, etc.</li>

<li>No need to upload anything, taken care of by the iPhone app.</li>

<li>Nice simple date based method of managing rides.</li>

<li>Being web based, easy to share.</li>

</ul><p><strong>Negatives</strong></p>



<ul><li>Inflexible. Small map that you can&#8217;t make bigger without hiding the graph.</li>

<li>Bad map presentation, in Map view it&#8217;s difficult to make out the path.</li>

<li>You have to use an iPhone. This is the biggest negative. Starting, stopping and pausing is cumbersome as the phone is in a pocket and often in a protective bag. The GPS also churns through the battery, it&#8217;ll completely drain on a 3 hour ride.</li>

</ul><h3><a href="http://connect.garmin.com/">Garmin Connect</a></h3>



<p>I was wary of Garmin Connect. Their client side software <em>sucks</em> and I thought Connect would be not much more than a bullet point on Garmin product&#8217;s feature lists. My concern was unfounded, Connect is highly polished and functional. I&#8217;d go as far to say it&#8217;s one of the better web applications out there.</p>



<p><strong>Positives</strong></p>



<ul><li>Good looking website that&#8217;s all round, easy to use and navigate.</li>

<li>Attractive, readable graphs.</li>

<li>Easy to get data from your device to Connect with their totally unobtrusive browser plugin.</li>

<li>Simple and useful reporting UI.</li>

<li>Being web based, easy to share.</li>

</ul><p><strong>Negatives</strong></p>



<ul><li>No map to graph interaction outside of a cumbersome Flash &#8220;player&#8221;.</li>

<li>No ability to layer graphs or compare rides.</li>

<li>Somewhat inflexible, you can&#8217;t enlarge the map or graphs.</li>

</ul><h3><a href="http://www.rubitrack.com/">Rubitrack</a></h3>



<p>Rubitrack is well put together and organised, a major advantage. UI conventions are followed and everything works the way you expect it to. The source list works like a contextual bunch of smart folders and it&#8217;s my favourite way any of these applications organise rides. But while it does some things brilliantly, it does others poorly.</p>



<p><strong>Positives</strong></p>



<ul><li>Well organised, Mac like UI.</li>

<li>Crystal clear map that visually represents zones.</li>

</ul><p><strong>Negatives</strong></p>



<ul><li>Crappy graphs in many ways. No interaction with the map, visually confusing and doesn&#8217;t display precise readings on hover. In practice, they&#8217;re static jpegs.</li>

<li>Forces you to save and maintain a library <em>file</em> which it doesn&#8217;t automatically load on next open. I hate this convention. When I&#8217;m using an application to interact with a &#8220;library&#8221; of something, I don&#8217;t want to manage afile, I don&#8217;t want to save or open, I want the data side of things to be invisible. I can&#8217;t think of any situation where I&#8217;d want to manage multiple Rubitrack libraries simultaneously.</li>

<li>The calendar view has potential but is poorly executed.</li>

</ul><h3><a href="http://trailrunnerx.com/">TrailRunner</a></h3>



<p>For donationware TrailRunner is surprisingly good but tries to be too much at the expense of absolutely nailing what it already does well. In some areas it&#8217;s polished to perfection, in others it almost seems broken.</p>



<p><strong>Positives</strong></p>



<ul><li>The best looking graphs of any of the applications listed here. Far and away the most well thought out and executed. Very easy to read layered graphs.</li>

<li>Ability to select a section of the graph which it will then display averages for and display that selection on the map. A brilliant idea that no other app has implemented let alone done so well.</li>

<li>Great looking maps and seamless graph + map integration.</li>

</ul><p><strong>Negatives</strong></p>



<ul><li>Disorganised UI. Sometimes I will get lost and don&#8217;t know how to get back to my list of rides. Labels are messy and unclear.</li>

<li>Some functions popup confusing windows which aren&#8217;t obvious how they integrate into the rest of the application.</li>

<li>Ugly, annoying copyright banner on the bottom of the map. I assume this is a requirement for map use without a commercial license but it&#8217;s distracting.</li>

<li>The same frustrating save file model as Rubitrack.</li>

</ul><h3><a href="http://www.montebellosoftware.com/index.html">Ascent</a></h3>



<p>Ascent is the Final Cut Pro of this category of applications. Raw UI with every kind of function at your disposal. The UI is just plain ugly and acts strangely, drop down buttons act like toggle switches and new windows are opened all over the place. It&#8217;s a powerful application but I can&#8217;t look past the unpolished UI.</p>



<p><strong>Positives</strong></p>



<ul><li>The option to dim the map background results in the best looking maps out of any application here.</li>

<li>There&#8217;s a great map view that shows your zones along the route. I don&#8217;t understand why this isn&#8217;t the default.</li>

</ul><p><strong>Negatives</strong></p>



<ul><li>Map and graph interaction is only possible when you have the graph popup open even though a graph exists as part of the main window.</li>

<li><em>Again</em>, Ascent forces you to manage library files! Why do they do this?! Could you imagine having to manually save your iTunes library every time you added a song to a playlist or change the smallest piece of meta data.</li>

<li>I simply can&#8217;t tolerate the interface and interaction quirks. There&#8217;s one text box which <em>opens up a modal text box</em> when it gains focus. Frustrating to use.</li>

</ul><h3><a href="http://www.garmin.com/garmin/cms/us/intosports/training_center">Garmin Training Center</a></h3>



<p>Granted it&#8217;s a &#8220;beta&#8221; but Garmin Training Center is too bad to dwell on. Don&#8217;t waste your time.</p>



<h3>Conclusion</h3>



<p>There is definitely no clear winner. All the client side options have the requirement for saving library files which pisses me off so much it&#8217;s a deal breaker across the board. Although each of them have their own individual pitfalls outside of the file issue. For now I&#8217;m sticking with Garmin Connect, although it lacks some features, it makes up for it by doing what it does do well. The UI is polished and and great reporting tools which I appreciate.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve looked into the files that my Garmin Edge collects and they&#8217;re nothing more than simple XML files which opens it up for me to play with this data myself. I had a great time creating the graph on <a href="http://ride.jimwhimpey.com">ride.jimwhimpey.com</a> with <a href="http://raphaeljs.com/">Raphael</a>, so I&#8217;m looking forward to diving into my cycling data with <a href="http://g.raphaeljs.com/">Graphael</a> and perhaps complimenting Garmin Connect with my own software.</p>
