<p>I refuse to believe that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gruen_transfer">Gruen Transfer</a> helps retail in any way. The kind of store that tends to stock the clothes I like, department stores, are notoriously the most &#8220;effective&#8221; implementors of the Gruen Transfer.</p>



<p>They scatter their clothes throughout a huge area. Shorts, T-shirts, collared shirts and jackets are all dispersed over 50mÂ². It&#8217;s impossible to compare the range and you&#8217;re forced to walk around.</p>



<p>When you finally find the clothes you want, you then have to find where to pay for it.</p>



<p>Surely frustrating your shoppers by forcing them to search for similar items and a place to pay for them couldn&#8217;t possibly outweigh helping shoppers find what they want and pay for it as efficiently as possible.</p>



<p>I imagine department store executives: <em>&#8220;I know! We&#8217;ll disorient our customers, make it difficult to browse our entire range and force them search for the place where they give us their money!&#8221;</em></p>
