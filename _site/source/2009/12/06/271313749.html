<p>18 months ago I wrote about <a href="http://archive.valhallaisland.com/blog/2008/my-ideal-house/">my ideal house</a>. Back then I was still living in my large, suburban, family home, hadn&#8217;t yet graduated and didn&#8217;t have much of a job. The old plan looked like this:</p>



<p><a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3078/2608929789_b254910584_o.png"><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ku7ot4uyUx1qzw2y9.png" alt="The Old Plan"/></a></p>



<p>Things couldn&#8217;t be much more different now. I have a job that pays well and I&#8217;ve lived 5 minutes outside the city in an apartment with my girlfriend for the better part of a year.</p>



<p>After 8 months living in an apartment my take on ideal living arrangements has changed â€” but not much. Most of the points I raised in my original post stand true now. Free standing houses beat apartments for windows and backyards, houses are usually much too large, one bathroom is enough, dining rooms are a waste of space, an outdoor area is important. I still agree with all these things and I think my original plan stands up well, I&#8217;d happily live alone in it today.</p>



<p>There was one glaring omission from the original plan that I mentioned but didn&#8217;t address, the complete lack of storage beyond a single wardrobe. I&#8217;m <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/266183205">not one</a> to needlessly keep much but often it&#8217;s unavoidable and it&#8217;s frustrating not having enough space or the right space kind to store things.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s the main issue I&#8217;ve tried to address in my revised plan but there&#8217;s lots of other stuff there too:</p>

<p>At first it looks <em>much</em> bigger, something I&#8217;m trying to avoid but note that I&#8217;ve included the patio/verandah area in this plan and as one floor is a basement, the overall footprint has only increased about 15%.</p>



<p>The biggest addition is the basement. You&#8217;d be hard pressed to find a house in Australia with a basement which is crazy, they&#8217;re a great, efficient use of space and could provide respite from the Summer heat. It addresses the lack of storage with the room on the left totally dedicated to it. I imagine lining those walls with shelves and cupboards, all removable to keep that room flexible.</p>



<p>The rest of the basement is multipurpose. It&#8217;s somewhat a typical garage space but I don&#8217;t own a car and don&#8217;t think cars belong inside anyway. Part laundry, part place to keep my bikes, bike paraphernalia, other training equipment and tools.</p>



<p>The door on the right wall of the basement is a typical garage roller door. Having to go to a separate garage or dragging my bike through the apartment sucks when I&#8217;m going in and out on bikes 4 times or more every day.  I imagine a ramp driveway cut into the ground to get down there. It&#8217;s not space efficient but I don&#8217;t see another way. That and the space stealing need for stairs are the worst thing about the addition of a basement.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve pulled the study into it&#8217;s own room. I have too much computer related <em>stuff</em> that&#8217;d clutter up the lounge room area. I also like the idea of totally concentrating on getting things done when in the office and using a laptop outside or on the couch for more &#8220;recreational&#8221; computing.</p>



<p>Basically it&#8217;s the same plan with additional storage and garage space.</p>

<p>Again <a href="http://static.jimwhimpey.com/images/idealhouseplan2.svg">I&#8217;m offering the SVG file</a> to aid others creating floor plans in their favourite vector editor. I&#8217;ve found applications like <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/OmniGraffle/">OminGraffle</a>, which should be perfect for things like this, dumb it down to the point where it hinders doing simple things.</p>
