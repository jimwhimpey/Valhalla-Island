<p>From every angle PayPal sucks. Yet, this story included, it remains the most viable option for accepting payment online. This is a sad state of affairs. I resent every second I&#8217;ve ever spent using PayPal&#8217;s unbelievably bad, fragmented developer documentation because even the best integration sucks for users and sucks for sellers.</p>



<p>There needs to be a PayPal exodus. Never again will I implement even the most inconsequential PayPal integration and neither should you.</p>
