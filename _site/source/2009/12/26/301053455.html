<p>This year I managed to land a huge amount of presents, most of them books. Despite my excitement about reading them I can&#8217;t help but feel that acquiring new books in 2009 is like building a fantastic HD-DVD library. The fact remains that books are simply the best way to read text. Although I haven&#8217;t tried a Kindle, I&#8217;d love it to prove even better.</p>
