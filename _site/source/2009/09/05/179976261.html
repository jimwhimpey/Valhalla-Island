<p>Like <a href="http://blog.cocoia.com/2009/exit-flash/">Sebastian</a> I&#8217;m a long time Flash hater and <a href="http://rentzsch.github.com/clicktoflash/">ClickToFlash</a> lover but I had no idea about it&#8217;s ability to switch out the YouTube Flash player for the native Quicktime Player. The advantages are huge: better quality, faster loading, improved tracking, invisible controls and it saves your processor working itself into a frenzy. ClickToFlash, already brilliant just got twice as good.</p>
