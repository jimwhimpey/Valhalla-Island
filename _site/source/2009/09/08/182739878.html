<img src="/assets/tumblr/tumblr_kpnf06u0VG1qzwfbio1_500.gif"/><br/><p><a href="http://www.daneharnett.com/widemail/">WideMail</a> and the <a href="http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/yojimbo-widescreen-view-hack">YoJimbo widescreen hack</a> had been doing their job silently and efficiently for so long that I totally forgot I was even using them. Snow Leopard broke Wide Mail and <a href="http://barebones.com/products/yojimbo/">YoJimbo 2</a> broke the hack with no new option to replace the need for a hack.</p>



<p>They&#8217;re two of my most used applications, two of the small group I keep running all the time. It&#8217;s really disrupted my computing experience. The item list on item view layout is so <em>inefficient</em> and contrary to the conceptual sense it makes to drill down from left to right.</p>



<p><a href="http://www.newsgator.com/INDIVIDUALS/NETNEWSWIRE/">NetNewsWire</a> defaults to the inferior layout but provides vastly superior options. I&#8217;m surprised Mail in Snow Leopard and YoJimbo 2 have persisted with the obviously inferior layout and no option to correct it.</p>
