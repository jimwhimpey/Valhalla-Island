<p>A service that allows products to be bought from US online stores, shipped to a US address before being forwarded on to an international address. Charge face value for shipping and a low percentage of the item&#8217;s value or a flat fee (say 3% or $20) for each shipment.</p>



<p>The Apple Store is a great example of where I&#8217;d use this service all the time.</p>



<p>Cost of the baseline Mac Pro from the Australian Apple Store: <strong>AU$4500</strong></p>



<p>Cost of the baseline Mac Pro from the US Apple Store after exchange rate conversion: <strong>AU$2860</strong></p>



<p>Over AU$1600 cheaper for an identical computer that simply originates at a different location, even if shipping was another $100 and the US-based package forwarder charged $100 for their simple service, it&#8217;s still much cheaper than buying it from the Australian store.</p>



<p>The biggest issue would be trust. What&#8217;s stopping them from keeping whatever you need forwarded? Apart from the &#8220;never deal with <em>x</em> again&#8221; blog post that could mean they never receive anything again. By then they might have a nice new computer delivered to their door so who cares?</p>



<p>If a service could build up a solid reputation of trustworthiness starting with inconsequential, cheaper items, it might work.</p>
