<p>For a long time I&#8217;ve been totally satisfied with the 24&#8221; iMac. It&#8217;s powerful (enough), the screen is big and it&#8217;s great value. Since picking up my new Macbook Pro, with it&#8217;s faster processor, LED screen and ability to power a 30&#8221; second screen my iMac feels very limited.</p>



<p>Then I <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/190104473">got frustrated</a> with my 20&#8221; second screen and started thinking about a single bigger display altogether. Just as I run out of hard drive space. The iMac can only power a second screen with resolution up to 1920 x 1280 (24&#8221; usually) but I want to ditch the dual setup, go single and bigger. The iMac can&#8217;t take additional external drives and even replacing the internal drive is a difficult task. I can always buy more external drives but they&#8217;re more expensive, can be unreliable when running through multiple USB hubs and the speed has nothing on internal drives.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m ready to upgrade from the iMac. So what&#8217;s the next step? The Mac Pro. A computer that starts at ridiculously powerful and the-cost-of-a-small-island expensive and only goes up from there.</p>



<p>My iMac is $2500, the baseline Mac Pro is $4500, add a 24&#8221; screen and you&#8217;re looking at $6000. A $3500 jump for the next logical step in the Mac desktop lineup. $3500 for the ability to customise with multiple hard drives and video cards. The gap between the iMac and the Mac Pro is huge. A Core 2 Duo powered Mac Pro would do the job but I doubt Apple want their Mac Pros to be seen as anything but beastly powerful machines.</p>
