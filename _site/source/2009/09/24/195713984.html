<p>Tumblarity is a curse. My tumblarity graphed would look something like a sine wave. I start low, feel no pressure, post what&#8217;s on my mind when it&#8217;s on my mind and find myself on a roll. My tumblarity rises. I feel a burden to keep it high, get anxious about finding or creating content to post, when I do have something I rush it together then worry about the right time of day to post or whether it&#8217;s good enough to post at all.  The result is contrived posts and less of them. My tumblarity gradually (it actually happens pretty quickly) drops to rock bottom, I feel free again, the writing and creativity flows. Repeat.</p>



<p>This whole process may have always happened naturally with slow weeks, good days and the like. Whatever algorithm powers tumblarity just does a great job of noticing.</p>
