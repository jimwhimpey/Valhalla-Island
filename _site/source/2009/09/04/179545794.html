<p>Last night I saw a friend&#8217;s band play over an hour away down the coast. I didn&#8217;t get home until after midnight but had to wake up at my usual 6am for work. Usually I get to bed at around 8.30 or 9pm and get a solid 9 hours sleep. Usually I go through 4 or 5 spells each day of uncontrollable yawning with a feeling of extreme tiredness and I never feel fully rested or as alert as I did today, after only 5 and a half hours sleep.</p>



<p>Amount of sleep to feeling of being rested is a parabolic function. Two hours too little or two hours too much, you&#8217;re just as tired all day. 9 hours is much more each night than anyone else I know, I&#8217;m going to start going to bed later to feel better rested with the bonus of an hour or two extra each day to get things done.</p>
