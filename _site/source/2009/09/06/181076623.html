<p>I&#8217;ve finally finished the traditional OS X major release review from John Siracusa at Ars Technica. It&#8217;s extremely long and split into a frustrating, <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a>-unfriendly 23 (!) pages but finish it knowing there&#8217;s no need to read another article on the subject. As always it&#8217;s written in a narrative style with a number of high quality visual aids. If you&#8217;re interested in Apple, Leopard, Snow Leopard, operating systems or <em>computers in general</em>, it&#8217;s well worth your time.</p>
