Not being able to remember a single detail first hand, it reveals the most yet about my accident. The top tube and down tube have crumpled, almost snapping in half. The left of the handlebars is bent backwards which explains the deep laceration on my left hand. The connections to the bottom bracket, not shown in this photo, have snapped clean away.</p>



<p>Incredibly there is zero damage to either wheel, not even a punctured tube. The bike damage tells me I was able to turn away in a last second attempt to avoid the car, which obviously wasn&#8217;t enough. Seeing the bike in this horrific state makes my stability and recovery to this point feel even more miraculous.</p>
