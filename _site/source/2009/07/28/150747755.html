<p>It&#8217;s great to see Lance back and take a spot on the podium but as a whole this year&#8217;s tour has not been satisfying. Cycling&#8217;s most <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/150702992">ungrateful and plainly disrespectful child</a> took the yellow while Cadel Evans once again languished behind a less than supportive, let alone strong team.</p>



<p>In 2010 I want to see an Australian sponsored team, based in Australia and staffed by Australian cyclists. We have a huge amount of talent but it&#8217;s dispersed between a myriad of European teams. I&#8217;d love to see a team made up primarily of Mick Rogers, Mark Renshaw, Stuart O&#8217;Grady, Heinrich Haussler, Brett Lancaster and Robbie MCewen with Cadel Evans at the helm. It&#8217;s a formidable bunch. Riding not only for their team but for their country might just be enough to give Cadel the support and motivation he needs to take home the yellow jersey.</p>



<p>I want to see the Cervelo Test Team back for their second year with Sastre in Contador-challenging form this time. The battle between Thor Hushovd and Mark Cavendish for the green jersey this year was spectacular, I hope the rivalry continues next year.</p>



<p>And finally I&#8217;m eagerly anticipating the full <a href="http://www.teamradioshack.com/getready/">Team RadioShack</a> lineup. Whoever they get I&#8217;m looking forward to them really sticking it to a Contador-lead team (if there&#8217;s anyone left who wants to call the selfish brat a team mate) next year.</p>
