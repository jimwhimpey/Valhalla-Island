<p>Often friends or family upon seeing my bedroom or computer setup comment on the &#8220;minimalism&#8221;. That description has never sat well with me. It&#8217;s not until I&#8217;ve started following minimalism blogs like <a href="http://minima.al3x.net/">Minima</a> and <a href="http://minimalmac.com/">Minimal Mac</a> that I&#8217;ve realised why.</p>



<p>What I&#8217;m striving for isn&#8217;t minimalism but simplicity. While simplicity is taking away all but the essentials I feel like minimalism is taking away all but the essentials <em>and then taking away more</em> merely for the sake of less at the cost of utility, convenience or comfort.</p>
