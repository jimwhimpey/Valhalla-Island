<blockquote>To me, &#8220;biking&#8221; is a belittling term that evokes fanny packs and hybrids, and I prefer the somewhat more dignified &#8220;cycling.</blockquote>I guess technically the word biking makes sense, there&#8217;s many other activities named the same way: skateboarding, trucking, roller blading, etc. Biking and biker still sounds gross to me, as if it&#8217;s the equivalent of calling walking shoeing.
