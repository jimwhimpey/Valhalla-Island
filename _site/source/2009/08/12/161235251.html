<p>Situations are always interesting when a random sample of people are brought together and forced to interact. My rehabilitation program is a great example: eight people, half male, half female, discrete age groups, social status, referred from different places and working in a variety of fields.</p>



<p>Something that bothers me is people who complain about problems they can fix but choose not to solve for whatever reason. This kind of person is represented heavily in my group.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m not the typical patient in my program. My back problems have existed for 5 weeks, since breaking my bones, most others have chronic problems that have been around for years or even decades. Invariably back problems can be solved simply â€” with the right exercise, body mechanics, stretching and posture.</p>



<p>Some group members have been attending back and neck rehabilitation programs for years, temporarily solving their problems but relapsing when they get &#8220;too busy&#8221; to keep up their exercise and stretching. It&#8217;s expected that we&#8217;ll continue our floor and cardio exercises for at least an hour a day five times per week when the program is complete. There&#8217;s no one that hasn&#8217;t complained about the burden of having to exercise when they have so little time as it is while simultaneously complaining about back pain, the stress it causes and the things it prevents them doing.</p>



<p>The patient who seems to have the most day to day issues flat out refuses to give up wearing high heeled shoes despite the physio and occupational therapist&#8217;s dire warnings against them. Another just doesn&#8217;t like wearing shoes with good arch support. It blows my mind that these people are willing to enrol in a two week, full-time rehabilitation program but are totally unwilling to wear a different kind of shoe. I can&#8217;t imagine how frustrating it must be for doctors.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not limited to taking care and responsibility for their own well-being either. A consistent topic of conversation is how terrible the traffic is. I talk about how great it is living in the city, so close to the hospital and all other amenities. They turn their nose up, <em>&#8220;I could never live in the city&#8221;</em>. Meanwhile, they&#8217;re spending two hours a day stuck in stop start traffic, complaining bitterly about it and can&#8217;t find a single hour per day to look after their health.</p>



<p>The exercise physiologist asked me whether I&#8217;ll have the time to continue the floor exercise program after the two weeks. Of course I&#8217;ll have time because I rent an apartment very close to my workplace, I work sane hours and getting back to 100% health is <em>the most</em> important thing in my life. Without that, little else, including the type of shoe I wear, matters.</p>
