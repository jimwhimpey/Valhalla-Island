<p><a href="http://www.marco.org/171819064">My gadgets tend to work and not break.</a></p><p>Like Marco my computer equipment, peripherals and gadgets tend to live long, healthy lives. I also rarely lose my keys or wallet but unlike Marco I was never poor or deprived, I put it down to being a careful person. It&#8217;s ridiculous the amount of people I know who have liquid spilt in laptop stories. I simply don&#8217;t have uncovered liquid near the laptop, <em>ever</em>.</p>



<p>In my case it extends to software. My computers and phone operate problem free while my friend&#8217;s and family&#8217;s equipment suffer a chronic barrage of issues. I don&#8217;t know what it is I&#8217;m doing differently but it works.</p>
