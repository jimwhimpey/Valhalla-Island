<p>Commercial television in Australia is saturated with ads for two products: cars and universities. <a href="http://www.griffith.edu.au/">Griffith University</a> releases a new advertising campaign every six months and runs it into the ground. <a href="http://www.uq.edu.au/">UQ</a>, <a href="http://www.qut.edu.au/">QUT</a> and <a href="http://www.bond.edu.au/index.htm">Bond</a> do the same. They don&#8217;t limit themselves to TV commercials, the campaign is spread across billboards, buses and stadium advertising. It must cost a lot of money.</p>



<p><a href="http://www.lambdassociates.org/blog/decline.htm">Dr Mark Tarver</a> has seen it first hand as a student and then a professor in Britain and I&#8217;ve experienced it as a student in Australia. Universities are far less about education than they are about making money. They&#8217;re not schools, they&#8217;re businesses selling an &#8216;education&#8217; product but they&#8217;re even doing a bad job of <em>that</em>.</p>



<p>Like so many other businesses: PC makers and phone manufacturers, every car manufacturer, they have it backwards. Start with a shitty, out-dated campus, facilities and program, then reverse your unappealing experience and poor reputation by spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on saturation advertising.</p>



<p>Mount Royal College, the university I attended in Calgary was an incredible place. It was a beautiful, modern campus and residence that featured manicured sports fields, tennis courts, volley ball courts and a huge, olympic-class gym unlike any I have ever seen before or since. The gym included three indoor basketball courts, an indoor running track, an indoor 25 metre pool, hot tub, steam room, 8 squash courts, a climbing wall and a floor full of new, well maintained weight and cardio equipment. The cost to use these facilities for students: $0. It&#8217;s impossible to find equivalent facilities, university or otherwise, in my city no matter how much money you&#8217;re willing to spend. Facilities half as good cost $800/year.</p>



<p>Compare that with the gym facilities at Griffith University&#8217;s largest campus. A 40m2 room with very little, out-dated equipment. The cost to students already paying $3000+ each semester: $100. The difference in gym facilities is a perfect subset of the greater differences betweens schools here and overseas, particularly in North America.</p>



<p>Before you even think about education, Mount Royal is a place you want to be a part of. They start with great facilities and let natural appeal and reputation take care of the marketing. Rather than blow every last dollar on advertising, money is spent on what must be the far more satisfying task of creating a great place to work and study. Both lure students, one has the bonus of happy, involved student body. It&#8217;s no coincidence that the teaching and instruction I received at Mount Royal was also superior and my fellow students were more interested and studious.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m sure schools like Harvard and Yale in the USA don&#8217;t spend a dime on advertising. They&#8217;ve built a reputation for quality in all areas. They didn&#8217;t win that reputation through relentless advertising campaigns.</p>
