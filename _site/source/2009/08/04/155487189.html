<p>Early next year I&#8217;m taking part in the <a href="http://ride.jdrf.org.au/default.asp">Ride to Cure Diabetes</a>. It&#8217;s a 160km ride through the hills of the Barossa Valley in South Australia. To be eligible to participate I need to raise $3500. I&#8217;ve setup <a href="http://ride.jimwhimpey.com/">a website</a> to collect donations, chart my progress, explain what Juvenile Diabetes is, why I&#8217;m doing it and why you should donate.</p>



<p>My sister was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes when she was 12 years old and I&#8217;ve seen first hand how it can affect a young person&#8217;s life. Type 1 Diabetes is treatable but it&#8217;s a heavy burden for a child to hold when the complications can be so severe. The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, the charity behind the ride to cure, are solely dedicated to finding a cure for Type 1 Diabetes. They don&#8217;t waste money on &#8220;awareness raising&#8221;, every donation goes towards the research that will eventually find a cure.</p>



<p>While the main purpose of riding is to raise funds for JDRF, recovering from <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/141205452">my bike accident</a> a little over a month ago is secondary. 160km through hilly terrain is an intimidating thought while my bike is <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/142504150">crushed</a> and 18 of my bones remain broken but it&#8217;s a goal that will only aid my recovery.</p>



<p>Donations are handled through <a href="http://ride.jdrf.org.au/teamParticipant.asp?participantID=35">my page at JDRF</a> but you can find more information and a cool graph I&#8217;ll be continually updating at <a href="http://ride.jimwhimpey.com/">my own fundraising website</a>. I&#8217;ll be hugely grateful for donations of any amount. If you run a business and would like a sponsorship arrangement I&#8217;m open to anything, contact me at <a href="mailto:jimwhimpey@me.com">jimwhimpey@me.com</a>. Thank you!</p>
