I accidentally ordered just a single band this time, which sucks considering the deteriorative nature of rubber bands and the time and cost of shipping to Australia.</p>



<p>The money band is the simplicity and low profile of a money clip without the pretension. Carrying so little is easy once you admit to yourself that you don&#8217;t need to keep every loyalty card, membership card and receipt you&#8217;ve ever acquired on you <em>all the time</em>. I&#8217;m down to 7 cards, 2 of which I haven&#8217;t used in weeks and I&#8217;ll drop from the group.</p>
