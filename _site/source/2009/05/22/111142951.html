<p>It&#8217;s crazy to <em>still</em> be talking about IE6 but the reality of the problems it causes remain.</p>



<p>The idea that a website has to look <em>identical</em> in every browser, even at the expense of design in browsers that render a page correctly, is insane. No one but the developer looks at the same website in multiple browsers, if it looks different between them, no one knows (let alone cares).</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve always said that the <em>content</em>, the reason the user is at the website in the first place will always be available in IE6 whether it&#8217;s with display perfection, CSS bugs or no CSS at all. It&#8217;s not worth hours hacking your way to perfect cross-browser consistency in a browser that is fundamentally flawed when no IE6 user knows what it&#8217;s supposed to look like anyway.</p>



<p>With anything under my control the philosophy is to completely ignore IE6. I spend my time developing better websites for browsers that work and worst case scenario (the most common scenario) it doesn&#8217;t <em>look</em> &#8220;right&#8221; in IE6, big fucking deal.</p>



<p>The universal IE6 stylesheet is doing a little more than nothing and I think, gets the balance right.</p>
