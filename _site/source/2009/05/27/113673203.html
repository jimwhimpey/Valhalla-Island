<p>Tomorrow will mark two weeks since we applied for naked DSL from <a href="http://www.iinet.net.au/index.html">iiNet</a> and we still don&#8217;t know when/if it will be connected. You&#8217;d think Australia&#8217;s third largest internet provider would have <em>signing people up</em> down to less than two weeks by now.</p>



<p>In the meantime our slow, expensive <a href="http://www.telstra.com.au/nextg/index.html">Telstra Next G</a> card is consistently dropping out and doesn&#8217;t allow traffic through ports 21 or 22, that rules out FTP, SFTP and SSH.</p>
