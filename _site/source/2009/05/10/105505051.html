<p>I&#8217;m frustrated by inconsistent tag input standards. There&#8217;s two kinds:</p>



<p><code>tag, tag one, another, a third tag</code></p>



<p><code>tag "tag one" another "a third tag"</code></p>



<p>The majority of applications use the former and it&#8217;s the best format. It never forces you to consider the amount of words in a tag and the comma is a natural separator.</p>



<p><a href="http://delicious.com/">Delicious</a> uses the latter, an application for which tagging is extremely useful and whose experience most benefits by reduced data input friction.</p>



<p>Spaces are quick when entering single word tags but don&#8217;t work as a logical separator, it feels like I&#8217;m writing a sentence rather than a series of individual keywords. It&#8217;s most annoying when entering multi word tags having to think about and account for multiple word tags before input. It stifles the spew of tags that come to mind when you&#8217;re quickly record and move on.</p>



<p>The problem is exacerbated when almost everything else does it differently making it difficult to even get used to the inferior system.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s decide on one method (the first) and make it the standard.</p>
