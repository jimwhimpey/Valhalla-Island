<blockquote>I’m a guy who doesn’t see anything good having come from the Internet. Period. [the Internet has] created this notion that anyone can have whatever they want at any given time. It’s as if the stores on Madison Avenue were open 24 hours a day. They feel entitled. They say, ‘Give it to me now,’ and if you don’t give it to them for free, they’ll steal it.</blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwd.com/media-news/fashion-memopad/memo-pad-uniqlo-nabs-deyn-bad-internet-classic-martha-2136751?src=rss/recentstories/20090515#/article/media-news/fashion-memopad/memo-pad-uniqlo-nabs-deyn-bad-internet-classic-martha-2136751?page=2">Michael Lynton, CEO Sony Pictures Entertainment</a></p>



<p>This is an incredible quote and exactly the reason these companies are failing. Not only do they not <em>get</em> the internet, they&#8217;re hostile towards it. They&#8217;re so blinded by their view of the internet as an avenue for illegal activity at their company&#8217;s expense that they fail to see <em>any</em> good or opportunity at all.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s despite iTunes, an <em>internet-only</em> music retailer, hitting <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2008/04/03itunes.html">the number 1 spot for music retailers in the US</a> (internet or otherwise) now with completely DRM-free tracks. There&#8217;s a million reasons why iTunes is better than piracy, it&#8217;s more reliable, faster, better quality, more easily searchable, the meta data is complete and correct, etc. Not to mention that it&#8217;s the legal and <em>moral</em> option. <a href="http://www.marco.org/109607811">As Marco says</a>, do better than the pirates and people are happy to pay.</p>
