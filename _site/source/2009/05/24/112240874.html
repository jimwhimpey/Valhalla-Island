<p>This clip sums up what I love most about Comedy and Everything Else. They&#8217;re not afraid to go to the extremes of silly or the extremes of seriousness. They get angry, they relaxed, they go slow and go fast.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m sure you know people who flat out refuse to talk about anything even remotely serious, those people who treat anything outside the tiny bubble of their immediate environment or day to day life not their problem and shoot down attempts to bring it up. Just as you know people who frown on the silly, who stare down a joke and refuse to make light of a situation. Often it&#8217;s the same person, the same person left with a bland middle ground of no opinion, personality or fun.</p>



<p>Comedy and Everything Else do what they feel. Playing radio with funny drop ins isn&#8217;t too silly and condemning torture isn&#8217;t too serious. The silly parts are hilarious, the serious is thought-provoking.</p>
