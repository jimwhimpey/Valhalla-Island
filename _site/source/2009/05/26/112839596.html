<p>I lived too close to university to justify moving out of home when I started. Being a student, I couldn&#8217;t afford it anyway. So I ended up spending more time at home than most. I did get a taste of what living out of home was like when I spent a semester on student exchange in Canada but that&#8217;s a very different kind of being away from home.</p>



<p>At 21, it feels like moving out has been a long time coming but really, it&#8217;s probably just about right. After a week to settle in with our few possessions, learn which light switch does what and buying the stuff we were missing, I couldn&#8217;t be happier.</p>



<h3>The City</h3>



<p>The number one reason we needed to move out was to get closer to work. I was commuting 1 hour and 45 minutes <em>each way</em> and Kristin was spending only a little less than that, it was totally ridiculous and it ruled my life. Kristin works in the city, I work just outside. We ended up finding a place in the best part of one of our <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/96424511">selected green zones</a>.</p>



<p>It takes me 5 minutes to get to work. I ride a small segment of the Bicentennial Bikeway that runs parallel to the river and cross just one street. The only other crossing is handled by a tunnel.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re only 3km outside the city CBD, close enough to easily ride into town but far enough that we don&#8217;t get the city noise or smell. Our street is wide, quiet and full of trees, shared with the Queensland Boy Scouts HQ. We have the neighbourhood of a suburb but the convenience of the city&#8217;s facilities and infrastructure.  We&#8217;re in the Brooklyn to Brisbane&#8217;s Manhattan.</p>



<p>With the extra 3 and a half hours I have spare each day now I&#8217;ve picked up training again. I&#8217;ve found a great running track along the river out to the University of Queensland, a massive and beautiful campus where I&#8217;ve taken a swimming pool membership too. On a nice day I&#8217;ll see 100+ people walking or running the same track, on a bad day I&#8217;ll still see 50. I&#8217;m not used to seeing so many people out and I love it.</p>



<h3>The Apartment</h3>



<p>Our apartment is perfect. We&#8217;re on the second floor of a small apartment complex. We have two big bedrooms, a big ensuite, heaps of cupboard space, a big lounge room, balcony and kitchen with lots of windows everywhere. The walls and floors are thick, we never hear a peep from anyone else in the complex.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a little rough around the edges with some carpet stains, marks and chips on the walls, things like that. Those things don&#8217;t bother me. Other places we saw were much smaller, had less facilities, were in worse locations but had been freshly renovated so cost more than our apartment. Marks on the wall are cosmetic and don&#8217;t affect your standard or living the way a tiny ensuite, no cupboards or lack of outdoor space would.</p>



<h3>An Internet Connection</h3>



<p>We had the power turned on quickly. Getting internet connected hasn&#8217;t been so easy. It&#8217;s been 12 days now since I applied for <a href="http://www.iinet.net.au/index.html">iiNet</a> online. I chose them for their naked DSL (we don&#8217;t need or want to pay for a landline), reasonable bandwidth limits, unmetred iTunes and Xbox Live access and their good reviews. There&#8217;s been a number of problems getting it setup including my inability to understand much of what iiNet&#8217;s call centre staff are saying on the phone.</p>



<p>We have internet in the meantime using a borrowed Telstra 3G express card. It&#8217;s expensive, slow, has low bandwidth limits and it&#8217;s own set of problems like having to connect to it through an old PC laptop and an ad-hoc wireless network. I&#8217;m looking forward to putting these problems behind me, iiNet assure me the issues are being worked through.</p>



<h3>Things I&#8217;m Most Enjoying</h3>



<p>Cooking my own dinner or not cooking anything at all if I&#8217;m not hungry. Not having to sequester my things in a room but put them where they belong. It&#8217;s amazing how good it feels to keep all my drink bottles in the kitchen. There&#8217;s 1000 small things but the winner is simply having the time to train, relax, read and mess around on the computer again.</p>



<h3>Things I&#8217;m Missing</h3>
