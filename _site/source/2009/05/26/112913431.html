The combination of moving the story along, reveals and further mystery was brilliant. The Rose and Bernard scene which basically countered everything the show is based on — people running around with guns trying to save other people — was a superb moment. The finale alone made up for every slow, boring filler episode Lost has ever aired.</p>
