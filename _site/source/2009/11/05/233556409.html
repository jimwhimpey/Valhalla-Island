<blockquote><p>Iâ€™m usually pretty bad about remembering to empty the Trash, but I think this is a personal record.</p></blockquote>



<p>I&#8217;m the opposite. Sometimes I&#8217;m so quick to right click the trash, ready to empty, after I&#8217;ve dropped something in it that it hasn&#8217;t registered yet and Empty Trash is still a greyed out option.</p>
