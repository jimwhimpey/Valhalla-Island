<p>I&#8217;m consistently intrigued by people&#8217;s reluctance to spend money on iPhone applications. People who&#8217;ll lay down $6 on a beer or coffee without blinking wouldn&#8217;t dream of spending $2.50 on an iPhone app.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not because of a disinterest in applications, the phones their paying $2000+ for over two years are packed with apps, free apps. A strange phenomenon.</p>
