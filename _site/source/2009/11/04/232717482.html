<p>At work we have very short, golf-green-like carpet, a putting machine and a broken putter. I went to <a href="http://www.cashconverters.com.au/">Cash Converters</a>, one of Australia&#8217;s second hand store chain to buy a replacement club. My only requirement was that it be functional, my budget was roughly $10.</p>



<p>As second hand stores do, they had many putters. About 15 of them and not one was on sale for less than $40 despite most looking very crappy and very used, exactly what I was after.</p>



<p>I looked around the store, a rack of DVDs, a couple of guitars, a cabinet of jewellery, 4 staff and no customers â€” it was sparse. Meanwhile every story I&#8217;ve heard is that Cash Converters brutally low balls on everything you try to sell them.</p>



<p>Sites like Craigslist, Gumtree, The Trading Post and Ebay are evidence there is a massive market for second hand goods. Yet Cash Converters, what should be the physical manifestation of these websites, stagnates with barely any stock and ridiculously high prices.</p>



<p>If they were willing to reduce their margins Cash Converters would make a great place. I&#8217;m perpetually unloading stuff I don&#8217;t use anymore, I&#8217;d love a place I could take it all at once and get a fair price, albeit a lower price than I&#8217;d get with the hassle of listing it, fielding enquiries and shipping it myself. As a consumer I&#8217;d love a place I could go to get something inconsequential like a putter for cheap. It feels like a huge missed opportunity.</p>
