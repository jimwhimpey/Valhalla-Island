It didn&#8217;t live up to my extremely high expectations but that&#8217;s not to say I didn&#8217;t enjoy it.</p>



<p>Still, every so often I go back to the trailer and want to see the movie again. A friend from work lent me the novel and I loved it, much more than I remember enjoying the movie.</p>



<p>Today I watched the movie again. I had a greater appreciation and better understanding having seen it once before and read the novel but it still didn&#8217;t live up to its potential. Watchmen is an intricate and complex story, the movie leaves a significant amount of that out, which is definitely fine but it then adds fat elsewhere.</p>



<p>One thing the movie did get right is the opening credits. In five minutes it completely covers the background story in a series of gorgeous slow motion scenes. It&#8217;s beautifully succinct in a way the rest of the movie is not.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s <a href="http://static.jimwhimpey.com/images/rorschach.jpg">another great still from the sequence</a> and I&#8217;ve cut <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0VmXfGHG_A">an HD version of the opening credits</a> at YouTube.</p>
