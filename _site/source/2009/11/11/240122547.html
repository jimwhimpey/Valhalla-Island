<p>I have avoided <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a> for <em>so</em> long. It reeks of people who think schmoozing and fortnightly &#8220;networking breakfasts&#8221; are the way to the top, a culture I actively avoid.</p>



<p>This afternoon it was the only search result for a person I was looking for. On their LinkedIn profile was a contact link. Contacting someone requires an account.</p>



<p>Already annoying but this is my only option. I resolve to sign up, email them and close my account. Signing up is a long, multiple step process that involves email activation. After logging in I have to skip my way through a number of information harvesting, data entry screens.</p>



<p>I find the guy I&#8217;m after and look for his email address. Not an option. I can send an &#8220;InMail&#8221;. I try to send an &#8220;InMail&#8221;. Not an option, to send an InMail I need to <strong>upgrade my account</strong>.</p>



<p>For the low price of $25/month I can send 3 &#8220;InMails&#8221;.</p>



<p>No. Fucking. Way.</p>



<p>I delete my account. My avoidance was well founded.</p>



<p>Please, everyone, buy <em>yourname</em>.com, put your email address on it and stop bullshit like LinkedIn dominating a search for your name. It&#8217;s bad for you, bad for people looking for you and good for the scumbags at LinkedIn.</p>
