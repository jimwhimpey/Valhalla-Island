<p>The wallpaper featured on Simple Desktops is good but I&#8217;d never use it or feature it on <a href="http://solidbase.tumblr.com/">A Solid Base</a>. I love the simplicity but I don&#8217;t like solid colours, hard lines or a single focal point, ironically or not, I find it all distracting.</p>
