<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wireless-International-Generation-charging-Australia/dp/B000GF7ZRA">Kindle Now Available in Australia (and the rest of the world)</a></p><p>This is very exciting.

Books are unwieldy and the iPhone makes a decent intermediate device but is far from ideal for reading in long stretches. I&#8217;ve really come to enjoy reading anything via <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> which bodes well for a device dedicated to reading.</p>
