<p>As much as <a href="http://last.fm/user/fightingfriends">I really enjoy music</a> and curate a decent-sized library, I&#8217;m bad at staying up to date with new releases from my favourite bands. Sometimes six months will pass before I&#8217;m even aware of a new album from someone I apparently love. So every time I use a tool like <a href="http://albumspotter.com/">Album Spotter</a> to find out what I&#8217;m missing, I get flooded with new, great music and it&#8217;s a joy. This is one of those songs.</p>
