While they&#8217;ve always had a relatively nice <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Brisbane_Lions_Jumper.svg">strip</a> their logo can only be described as dated and one of the ugliest logos <em>of all time</em>. As of just a few hours ago that&#8217;s been totally turned around with this gorgeous new look. The colours, type, illustration and composition are all perfect, they couldn&#8217;t have done a better job.</p>



<p>It also looks great in single colour and <a href="http://static.jimwhimpey.com/images/lions-variations.jpg">a number of variations</a> making it super flexible â€” the opposite of the old, complicated, multi-gradient atrocity.</p>
