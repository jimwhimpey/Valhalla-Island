<p>That resonated with me then was clearly demonstrated to me this week.</p>



<p>Two days ago I was <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/217965736">obviously excited</a> about  the new internationally available Amazon Kindle. I&#8217;d wanted one for a long time but it&#8217;s only now a possibility. Buying one was only a matter of having enough spare cash.</p>



<p>Enter the <a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/nook/index.asp">Nook</a>.</p>



<p>Is it better than the Kindle? It&#8217;s not as well established, the Kindle&#8217;s already had many great reviews but maybe the Nook has learnt from the few issues people have with the Kindle? It has a touch screen colour LCD and virtual keyboard, is that better than the Kindle&#8217;s equivalent? Is wifi important? Does Barnes &amp; Noble have the same range of books at similar prices? Are they better prices? How does battery life compare? Is it insignificant when both devices have such long battery life? Is the ability to share important to me? If it&#8217;s important is it even practical?</p>



<p>What two days ago was a sure thing is now a mountain of questions and I&#8217;m weighed down by the burden to decide.</p>



<p>So I consolidate the questions down to one: do I need an eBook reader at all?</p>



<p>No.</p>



<p>Burden relieved.</p>
