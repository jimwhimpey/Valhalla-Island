<h3>What I consider a holiday</h3>



<p>No obligation to do anything and the freedom to do whatever I want.</p>



<h3>What I don&#8217;t consider a holiday</h3>



<p>Living out of a bag for a month while hopping from city to city constantly thinking about where I&#8217;m next going to shower or eat. A slave to the dwindling amount of money I have left and what my accommodation allows or can facilitate.</p>
