<p><a href="http://finerthingsinmac.com/post/213739385/snow-leopard-digitalcolor-meter-copies-hex-values">Snow Leopard: DigitalColor Meter copies hex values properly</a></p><p>My submission to <a href="http://finerthingsinmac.com/">Finer Things in Mac</a>. At first I didn&#8217;t think they credited me and was pissed off until I visited the post outside of the dashboard where it displays my username automatically. It&#8217;s done the same way for every other user submission on FTiM which up until now I&#8217;d assumed were all coming from the blog&#8217;s author because of the lack of sourcing in the post body.</p>



<p>When your entire blog is built on generous user submissions a simple &#8220;Thanks <em>blah</em>&#8221; to close off each post wouldn&#8217;t go astray.</p>
