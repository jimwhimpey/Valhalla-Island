<p>In the <a href="http://comedyandeverythingelse.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=493607">latest episode of Comedy and Everything Else</a> Patton Oswalt suggests movie theatres install headphone jacks under each seat so you can bring your own high quality headphones. You&#8217;d keep the big screen experience and the audio quality but wouldn&#8217;t have to put up with the noise from other moviegoers. Drive-thrus have done it from the beginning. It&#8217;s a fantastic idea.</p>
