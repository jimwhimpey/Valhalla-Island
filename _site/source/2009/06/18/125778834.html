<p>I hadn&#8217;t realised until last night that I&#8217;d been getting to sleep easily since moving out. It took having a hard time getting to sleep last night to realise. Up until last night I had no internet connection (beyond edge on the phone) so before bed I&#8217;d watch TV, a movie or read. Yesterday my internet was connected and I was up (relatively) late on the computer before going straight to bed. Lying in bed my mind was left buzzing and it took an hour to get to sleep, despite getting to bed hours later than usual.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve always known a winding down period before bed made a big difference but never has it been so obviously proven as it was last night.</p>
