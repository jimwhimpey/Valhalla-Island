<p>Tumblr has approved a bunch of new themes for <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/themes/recent">The Garden</a> over the weekend, with them was my latest theme, <a href="http://daydreamtheme.tumblr.com/">Day Dream</a>. Designed to have wider appeal than my first, dark, monospaced font only theme, I&#8217;m hoping this one will be a bit more popular.</p>



<p>Sidenote: The theme garden is quite full now and the current structure isn&#8217;t scaling well. I&#8217;m sure Tumblr is working on it but even permalinks in the form of in page anchors on the recent page would be nice in the mean time.</p>
