  <p>This seems to be a prevalent feeling. To most people, the computer is an annoying tool that they reluctantly use because their job requires it, and mobile phones are a way for their boss to reach them wherever they are, creating an expectation of constant availability for “working”.</p>

  

  <p>I’ve never viewed my connected technology this way. Yes, computers and phones are a way for me to be connected to my work. But they’re also my play, my hobby, my leisure, my education, my exposure to society, and my enlightenment. I like this connection.</p>

<p>I feel exactly the same way as <a href="http://www.marco.org/50873688">Marco</a>. The attitude amongst most people I know is that the computer is an inherently bad thing. Sure it&#8217;s convenient to do some things and a requirement for others but at its core the computer is <em>bad</em> and must be excluded or avoided wherever possible. I can&#8217;t help but think it has something to do with the pain that is using Windows.</p>
