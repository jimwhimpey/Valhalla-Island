<p>I just entered the <a href="http://www.capricornhalf.com/">Capricorn Half Ironman</a> that runs in just two months time. Also known as a 70.3 (miles), it&#8217;s two and a half times longer than anything I&#8217;ve entered before. It&#8217;s one of the earliest and apparently easiest of the qualifying races for Ironman Australia. I&#8217;m shitting myself.</p>
