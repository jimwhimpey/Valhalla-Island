<p>No matter where you are in the world you&#8217;ve probably heard about the devastation of the <a href="http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2009/02/bushfires_in_victoria_australi.html">Victorian Bushfires</a> over the last few weeks. Over two hundred people lost their lives and thousands more lost everything they owned.</p>



<p>Today was a national day of mourning and my girlfriend and I were talking to her Mum about the loss. She couldn&#8217;t believe how people could deal with losing everything.</p>



<p>A bit of back story. My girlfriend has a huge family that&#8217;s lived in the same huge house on a huge block of land for the last 19 years. They keep <em>everything</em>.</p>



<p>As long as you were fully insured, I&#8217;d see it less as loss and more of a fresh start. As much as I think about it, I can&#8217;t think of a possession I own that couldn&#8217;t be replaced by money. But what about the photographs?! All the best are hosted at <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jimwhimpey/">Flickr</a> and the rest are backed up at <a href="http://www.apple.com/mobileme/">MobileMe</a>. Any printed photographs I own originated as digital files I&#8217;ll still have.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve found a lot of people have sentimental and emotional attachments to material things: cars, furniture, computers, phones. When I sold my piece of shit car, my Mum asked if I said good bye to it. No, I didn&#8217;t, because it&#8217;s just a mass produced hunk of metal and plastic.</p>



<p>Already someone who doesn&#8217;t believe in sentimental value, who throws away anything that has no practical use, spending four months overseas living out of a single backpack made it clear how easy it was to live with even less. While the shock of &#8220;losing everything you&#8217;ve worked your whole life to attain&#8221; would be great at first, I&#8217;m sure many of the bushfire victims who&#8217;s friends, family and pets are still alive will soon realise how little they&#8217;ve lost in the big scheme of things.</p>
