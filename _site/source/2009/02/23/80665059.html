<blockquote><p>Why don’t we have solar panels on the hood and roof of our cars? Cars sit outside in the sun all day, especially in cities. I know they couldn’t draw enough power to function, but every bit of gas we don’t have to use seems like a good idea.</p>



<p>The sun is just sitting up there. Let’s use it.</p></blockquote>



<p>I&#8217;ve had exactly the same thought about lining the roofs of houses with solar panels. They&#8217;re far more likely to be sitting in the sun all day. Why not commit it to law that roofs must be lined with solar panels?</p>
