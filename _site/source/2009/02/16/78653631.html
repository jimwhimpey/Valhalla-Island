<p>This is it, I finished a first round version of my Tumblr theme. Called Downpour you can find it and use it yourself at <a href="http://github.com/jimwhimpey/downpour/tree/master">github</a>. It&#8217;s based strongly on the TextMate syntax highlighting scheme Blackboard. One day I may polish it to the point where it could be added to the directory. That day is not today.</p>
