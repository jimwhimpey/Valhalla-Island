<p><a href="http://www.wired.com/politics/law/magazine/17-04/ff_diamonds?currentPage=all">The Untold Story of the World's Biggest Diamond Heist</a></p><p>Remarkably similar to all the Ocean&#8217;s Eleven movies, Ocean&#8217;s Thirteen in particular. Contains every element of a movie script including the old friend who&#8217;s probably not right for the job but is included out of loyalty. It strikes me that Wired probably isn&#8217;t the place for this amazing story. Via <a href="http://waxy.org/links/">Waxy</a>.</p>
