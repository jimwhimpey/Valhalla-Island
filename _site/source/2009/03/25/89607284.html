<p><a href="http://daydreamtheme.tumblr.com/"><img src="/assets/tumblr/oaQecruTZlh4bp2wbuOviW3eo1_500.png"/></a></p><p>I spent yesterday and this morning building <a href="http://daydreamtheme.tumblr.com/">Day Dream</a> a new Tumblr theme. This one should have much wider appeal than <a href="http://downpourtheme.tumblr.com/">Downpour</a>, my first attempt at Tumblr theme creation (its now available on the <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/themes/recent">Theme Garden</a>). I&#8217;ve submitted Day Dream to the garden but it takes them a while, in the mean time you can download it from its <a href="http://github.com/jimwhimpey/day-dream/tree/master">Github repository</a>.</p>
