<p>I&#8217;ve noticed a trend over the last few years of laptop computers being chosen over desktop computers regardless of where or how they&#8217;ll be used. When people first started getting computers in their homes <em>no one</em> had laptops. It was rare to even see a laptop 10 years ago.</p>



<p>Now they&#8217;re everywhere.</p>



<p>The head designer at a print shop I worked at during university used a 17&#8221;, $4000 laptop that not once, during my 6 months stay there, moved from her desk. For half the price she could have had an iMac with a 24&#8221; display and more power.</p>



<p>I was surprised to find out that many of my classmates who took notes in a notebook had laptops at home they never brought to class.</p>



<p>I rented a ute from a car rental shop down the street from me a few weeks ago. In their office sat a small laptop hooked up to an ethernet cable, printer, external keyboard, mouse and hard drive.</p>



<p>My girlfriend owns a laptop who&#8217;s greatest journey has been a move from one part of her desk to another. She didn&#8217;t choose the laptop, it got given to her but when she decided she wanted to upgrade her instinct was laptop, despite the years worth of evidence she doesn&#8217;t need a portable computer.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t understand it. Desktops are more powerful, have bigger screens, are easier to expand, more comfortable to operate and still <em>cost less</em>. The premium you pay for a laptop covers one thing: portability, if you&#8217;re never going to move it, save your money, get a better desktop.</p>
