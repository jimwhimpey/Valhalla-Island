<p>I like to think of the financial crisis not as a disaster but as a correction.</p>



<p>During times of prosperity our means increase and we indulge in luxuries we couldn&#8217;t previously afford. Often the luxuries are beyond even our new found means because of the false promise of further prosperity. Enough time with these luxuries and they become the status quo. Recede one step backwards over a year and it feels like a crisis, despite the 10 steps forward you&#8217;ve taken during the 10 years previous.</p>



<p>If businesses can&#8217;t afford staff that do nothing, social media consultants fail to get contracts for the contrived, pointless job they do or car manufacturers struggle to sell the same bland, overpriced, void-of-any-innovation machines they&#8217;ve been pedalling for the last 30 years, so what?</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a trimming down, forcing people to do real jobs, do them well and forcing business to innovate and cut the fat from their operations. It pushes people to live back within their means and change their opulent lifestyle that existed on borrowed money.</p>



<p>If all the financial crisis does is force everyone into a simpler, less ostentatious lifestyle then I welcome the recession.</p>
