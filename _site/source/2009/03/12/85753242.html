<p>They&#8217;re obviously <em>different</em> but what are the advantages and disadvantage of each? That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been researching today, here&#8217;s a summary of what I found.</p>



<p>TT bikes are designed to be the most <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerodynamics">aerodynamic</a> possible. Not just in the bike&#8217;s frame and components but the position they force you to ride in. They have a more upright seat tube, shorter wheel base, shorter top tube and low aerobars which together force riders to crouch low, minimising drag and hopefully going faster.</p>



<p>But wouldn&#8217;t road bikes also benefit from these drag reducing features? Yes but the trade off in a TT or triathlon bike is less manoeuvrability and a less comfortable ride. Depending on your body and what you&#8217;re used to the ride could be so uncomfortable that it affects your riding style and speed negating any advantage gained by reducing drag.</p>



<p>Less manoeuvrability means more difficultly navigating tight courses and much more difficulty climbing. Less comfort means fatigue over long distances.</p>



<p>So basically, road bikes are for long distances and hills, TT bikes are for short, generally straight and flat courses where every second counts.</p>



<p>Then why are TT-style triathlon bikes rode in races like the Ironman, with a 180km bike course that&#8217;s just as long as any given stage in the Tour de France? For one, personal aerodynamics are much more important in a triathlon that doesn&#8217;t allow <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_bicycle_racing#Tactics">drafting</a> (the drag reducing advantage of drafting in a tour is much greater than a flatter riding style or aerodynamic bike frame can provide). Ironman bike courses also tend to loop and contain limited hills. If rode regularly and fitted properly a TT bike is far less uncomfortable.</p>



<p>As a beginner triathlete I think it&#8217;s still difficult to say which way to go.</p>
