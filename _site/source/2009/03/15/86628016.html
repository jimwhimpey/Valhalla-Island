<p>It&#8217;s difficult to tell whether the revolt each time Facebook makes significant changes is because of a resistance to change or having to learn.</p>



<p>Maybe it&#8217;s just a knee-jerk reaction to the sudden realisation of what people consider <em>their own</em> being entirely out of their control. Facebook makes up the massive majority of many people&#8217;s online time â€” my sister can spend hours on the computer <em>exclusively</em> using Facebook. My non-technical friends who struggle to operate an iPod are <em>experts</em> with the Facebook UI. When you invest that kind of time in something, realising it&#8217;s not yours, that Facebook can do whatever the fuck they want, must be a shock.</p>



<p>People went ape shit when the last changes launched, now those same people are going ape shit about <em>keeping</em> the last changes. Groups will be created, notes written, statuses updated all <em>using the new Facebook</em> to complain about how the new Facebook is so difficult to use. Within a week they&#8217;ll forget Facebook ever looked or behaved differently.</p>
