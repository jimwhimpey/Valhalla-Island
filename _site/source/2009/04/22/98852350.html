<blockquote>They might as well name it â€œWindows 7: We Hold You in Contempt and Dare You, Fucking Dare You, to Try Something Else Edition</blockquote><p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/04/21/windows-7-starter">John Gruber</a> in response to the news Windows 7 Starter Edition only allows <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/Bott/?p=844">3 applications to run at any one time</a>.</p>



<p>This is mind-blowingly stupid. I was going to say &#8220;it&#8217;s like Microsoft is going out of it&#8217;s way to frustrate and annoy users&#8221; but it&#8217;s not like anything, Microsoft <em>actually is</em> going out of it&#8217;s way to frustrate and annoy users.</p>



<p>The only possible justification for such a ridiculous limitation is &#8220;incentive&#8221; to &#8220;upgrade&#8221; to a more expensive &#8220;fully featured&#8221; edition of Windows 7. After experiencing total frustration and being effectively bribed by a crippled OS, is forking out more money for a different version of <em>the same OS</em> something anyone is going to feel good about?</p>



<p>Every Windows user I know has the it&#8217;s not that bad, I can live with it mindset. But with each new version it&#8217;s getting <em>that</em> bad and when you can&#8217;t listen to music while downloading a movie, reading RSS feeds and running IM <em>living with it</em> starts to really suck. How bad does it have to get before people will switch to fully featured, cheaper (even free!) alternatives? It can&#8217;t be long</p>
