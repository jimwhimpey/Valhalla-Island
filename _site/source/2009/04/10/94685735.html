<p><a href="http://www.marco.org/94597755">Marco Pulls Apart a Microsoft Sponsored Study on the "Apple Tax"</a></p><p>I totally agree that Apple stuff is overpriced as far as the high end stuff goes, that is, Macbook Pros and Mac Pros. Although that could just be a hunch because I&#8217;ve never researched a PC with identical or very similar specifications to Apple&#8217;s top of the line computers.</p>



<p>But when it comes to the consumer stuff, Macbooks, iMacs and Mac Minis, the prices are on par. Find a PC with the same specs as a Macbook and it costs about the same. You see really cheap, sub $1000 PC laptops because they&#8217;re simply not as good, Apple don&#8217;t even make a comparable computer so comparing a bottom of the range $600 Dell to a $1600 Macbook on price is unfair.</p>



<p>If Microsoft truly believed there was an Apple Tax on consumer computers then there&#8217;d be no need to rig the study with all the bullshit Marco points out.</p>
