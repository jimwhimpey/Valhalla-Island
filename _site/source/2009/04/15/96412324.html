<p>Absolutely incredible. I greatly admire this kid&#8217;s determination, resolve and physical endurance. I&#8217;m also impressed with his parents for acting rationally when they noticed him withdrawing money from his bank account by depositing extra funds so he&#8217;d have enough to pay for food.</p>



<p>The huge distances he covered day after day resemble the type of riding required to race a tour. A cycling team should pick him up.</p>
