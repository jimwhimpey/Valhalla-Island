<p>Over the weekend I managed to drop my iPhone 4 on concrete before immediately stomping on it just to make sure it was properly smashed. I&#8217;m not too bothered because my contract ends in a month and I would be getting a new iPhone (hopefully an iPhone 5) for no extra money. Until that time I have a borrowed 3GS and some observations:</p>



<ul><li>The screen is <em>horrible</em>. It&#8217;s amazing how quickly I got used to and proceed to take the Retina Display for granted.</li>

<li>The camera is also crappy. The iPhone 4 camera rivals any point and shoot I&#8217;ve ever used, the 3GS camera is a very much a phone camera.</li>

<li>The 3GS hardware doesn&#8217;t look as good as the iPhone 4 hardware but it feels <em>much</em> nicer in the hand.</li>

</ul><p>Those a really the only differences. The 3GS is still a great phone and I can see why Apple is still selling it.</p>
