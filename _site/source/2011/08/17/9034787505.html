<p>This story seems to me like an incredibly obvious case of missing the point. There is nothing inherent about watching coloured pixels flicker that would cause ill-effects to your health.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s far more likely that sitting for long periods is a problem in which case the fact a TV is on in your line of sight makes no difference. Reading a book or listening to a podcast on the couch would produce the same results. It&#8217;s also likely that high amounts of TV watching is an indicator of less time spent exercising or cooking fresh, healthy meals.</p>



<p>Their conclusion is the equivalent of claiming spending time inside a McDonalds restaurant directly relates to the purchase of plus size clothing.</p>
