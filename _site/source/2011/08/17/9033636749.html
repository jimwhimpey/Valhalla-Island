  <p>This is the feature I&#8217;m most looking forward to in <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/whats-new/features.html">Lion</a>. Many times a day I go through the process of typing a sentence, seeing the red underline on a word, switching to the mouse, right clicking, selecting the first correct spelling suggestion, moving back to the end of the sentence and continuing. I always wished you could access that contextual menu with just the keyboard but this Lion feature completely eliminates the need.</p>

<p>I wrote that a few months ago, saved it as a draft and didn&#8217;t publish for some reason. A month into Lion and I can say that my anticipation was well-founded, I <em>love</em> auto correct in Lion. <a href="http://adium.im/">Adium</a> doesn&#8217;t yet support it and it&#8217;s hugely frustrating, I don&#8217;t know how I lived without it.</p>
