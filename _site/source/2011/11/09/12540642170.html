<blockquote>Social networks exist to sell you crap. The icky feeling you get when your friend starts to talk to you about Amway, or when you spot someone passing out business cards at a birthday party, is the entire driving force behind a site like Facebook.</blockquote><p>Pinboard&#8217;s Maciej <a href="http://blog.pinboard.in/2011/11/the_social_graph_is_neither/">articulating</a> many of the problems I have with Facebook et al.</p>



<p>It was a couple of weeks ago when work colleagues, who were already Facebook friends, started sending me requests to define our working relationship. That is, &#8220;Barry says he works with you: confirm/deny&#8221;. I thought, why the fuck do people feel the need to supply Facebook with this kind of metadata? Then I realised that question applied to me too and so my account was deleted.</p>
