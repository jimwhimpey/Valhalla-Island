Something about this show really hit the spot for me, as it did for a lot of people and as no other TV show or movie has since.</p>



<p>So I&#8217;ve started watching it again from the beginning with Anne, who hasn&#8217;t seen a single episode.</p>



<p>I knew there&#8217;d be many extra things I&#8217;d pick up on having already been through the series once but there was a beautiful moment in season 1, episode 2 when Locke is teaching backgammon to Walt. He holds up the pieces and explains, &#8220;two sides, one is light, one is dark&#8221; followed by a long pause. This would become the theme through the next 100 episodes.</p>
