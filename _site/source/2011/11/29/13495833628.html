<p>In a typical case of assholery, Mike Arrington misappropriated Jamie Zawinski&#8217;s comments from over 15 years ago to support his gross, self-serving argument for startup employees <a href="http://uncrunched.com/2011/11/27/startups-are-hard-so-work-more-cry-less-and-quit-all-the-whining/">working themselves into the ground</a>.</p>



<p>Delightfully, Jamie <a href="http://www.jwz.org/blog/2011/11/watch-a-vc-use-my-name-to-sell-a-con/">responded</a>:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>What <em>is</em> true is that for a VC&#8217;s business model to work, it&#8217;s necessary for you to give up <em>your</em> life in order for <em>him</em> to become richer.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>At the end of Arrington&#8217;s diatribe he links to <a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/11/27/zyngas-tough-culture-risks-a-talent-drain/">this NY Times post</a> titled, Zyngaâ€™s Tough Culture Risks a Talent Drain with the comment: &#8220;FFS, the place has free acupuncture and an organic cafeteria&#8221; as though that somehow makes up for&#8230; urgh, I can&#8217;t even respond.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve never used any of Zynga&#8217;s stuff so I can&#8217;t comment on the result first hand but I think the fourth comment on that article unintentionally summarises the situation beautifully:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Zynga&#8217;s software is terrible. Their programmers don&#8217;t deserve their stock options. How is it possible that all those hard charging long hours add up to the most dysfunctional experience on the internet?</p>

</blockquote>



<p><em>Good question</em>.</p>



<p>The answer is that a quality result not only has little to do with <em>raw hours</em> but is often inversely proportional to the amount of hours spent on something beyond what allows a balanced life. The currency of a developer is brain <em>power</em>, not brain time. The kind of conditions Arrington is advocating is like suggesting a terrible song would be much more popular if only it went for twice as long.</p>
