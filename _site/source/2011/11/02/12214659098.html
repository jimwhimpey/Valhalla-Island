<p>Some other incredible <em>potential</em> new features include remotely setting the security level of an employee&#8217;s phone to &#8220;level 5&#8221; and a phone which shows you a photo of yourself when you go through a security door. These are the kind of things RIM imagines when they&#8217;re fantasising about a future without factoring in a single real world constraint.</p>



<p>Best case scenario <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2011/11/companies_that_publish_concept_videos">future concept videos are dumb</a> but one that imagines something this boring sounds like RIM&#8217;s death knell.</p>
