<p>For $35/month Fancy Hands, &#8220;Personal Assistant for Everyone&#8221;, can do 15 tasks of this nature (taken from their <a href="http://www.fancyhands.com/common?top=1">10 most commonly requested tasks</a>:</p>



<blockquote>

  <ul><li>Restaurant Reservations</li>

  <li>Scheduling a car service / taxi pickup</li>

  <li>Schedule a haircut with [stylist] on Friday after 1pm</li>

  <li>Find a couple upholsterer options near where I work</li>

  <li>Call some hotel and extend my stay for three nights instead of two</li>

  </ul></blockquote>



<p>Seems to me that you&#8217;re paying $35/month to send 15 emails instead of making 15 phone calls or doing 15 Google searches. Typing &#8220;Upholsterer near X location&#8221; into Google Maps is initially faster than sending a coherent email and not only will the results be returned instantly but they&#8217;re interactive. As for booking a taxi, a haircut or changing a hotel reservation these are 30 second phone calls which resolve instantly.</p>



<p>Legitimately time saving and useful stuff like picking up laundry, recurring tasks or even the graphical theme of their website — a bellhop carrying bags — <a href="http://www.fancyhands.com/not/good/for?c=bellhop">they can&#8217;t do</a>. I imagine the real advantage of a personal assistant would come from tight integration with your life. Things like the ability to go places for you, fill out your calendar, read your email and buy things are all outside the realm of Fancy Hands.</p>



<p>Maybe people are willing to pay $35/month for the illusion of a personal assistant.</p>
