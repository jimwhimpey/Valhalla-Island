I was the only one to show up and decided to leave a couple of hours later when the water around the building rose further.</p>



<p>I was nowhere near the river or and flood plain last night and woke up to the first sunshine we&#8217;ve had in weeks so I decided to go on my regular Wednesday morning ride. It was obvious pretty quickly that wasn&#8217;t going to happen so I just rode around the city and the river <a href="http://darkroom.heroku.com/photos/jimwhimpey/sets/72157625677684151/">taking a few photos</a> before heading to work.</p>



<p>The city is in pandemonium with some streets totally deserted and others full of people and cars. Bicycle is definitely the best way to get around in a situation like this. The whole thing feels surreal and it&#8217;s very difficult to gauge the seriousness of it.</p>
