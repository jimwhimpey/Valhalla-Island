It was probably participating in that race which most severely hampered his bid for the 2010 yellow jersey.</p>



<p>This year he raced the much more sedate Tour de Romandie (and won) in preparation. This year, his 7th year, at 34 years old, Cadel Evans won the Tour de France.</p>



<p>He is an emotional man who struggles with the spoken word and media attention but whose legs and heart could not have communicated with more clarity over the last three weeks and last two years. His victory and the way he did it fill me with pride as an Australian and cycling fan.</p>
