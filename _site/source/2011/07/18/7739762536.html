<blockquote>Unfortunately we know vandalism of school property is an all-too-common problem. From my standpoint as Prime Minister and someone very passionate about a high-quality education, we want kids to have the benefits of all the resources in our schools and we don&#8217;t want to see these wanton acts of destruction in any school.</blockquote><p>Julia Gillard in response to <a href="http://abc.net.au/news/2011-07-18/unley-school-fire-arrests/2798262">vandals setting fire to her old school</a>.</p>



<p>This quote highlights the worst thing about Gillard. Every fucking word that comes out of her mouth is monotonous, politicised nothing speak. <em>Kids burnt your school</em>, far out, show some emotion.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s just like last week, when she was <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-07-13/woman-confronts-julia-gillard-over-carbon-tax/2793462">confronted in a shopping centre</a> by someone with a legitimate question who (unlike most Australians) was well informed on this issue. In my ideal world Gillard would tell the woman, &#8220;yes, I said I wouldn&#8217;t do this previously but now I have more information, it&#8217;s a three year stepping stone and <em>it&#8217;s the right thing to do</em>&#8221;. Instead she completely ignores the words the woman is saying and just repeats the party line. To her credit the woman doesn&#8217;t want any of it and makes the situation awkward.</p>



<p>I can somewhat understand the meaningless political babble being told to the lazy press but when you&#8217;re one on one with a voter telling you they understand <em>what the carbon tax is</em> and Gillard just repeats the same &#8220;we&#8217;re implementing a carbon tax for the 500 big polluters blah blah blah&#8221; I question whether she&#8217;s actually a robot dressed as a human.</p>
