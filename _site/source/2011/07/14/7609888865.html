It was taken a couple of hundred metres from the finish line of this year&#8217;s Tour de France stage 4 and I can&#8217;t stop looking at it.</p>



<p>Cadel won the stage by a few centimetres by delivering a sustained attack so vicious that neither Alberto Contador, undisputedly the best climber in the world, nor Philippe Gilbert, a man who just months ago swept the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ardennes_classics">Ardennes classics</a> by destroying the rest of the field on uphill finishes exactly like this one, could come around him.</p>



<p>Those faces belong to two of the most dominant men, not only in cycling, but in this specific kind of finish and they are <em>in pain</em>. Not once this year in any of Gilbert&#8217;s destructive Ardennes wins or throughout Contador&#8217;s Giro dominance did they look like <em>that</em>. Cadel, an Australian, is on the front, determination contorting his face and body, forcing <em>the best</em> to turn themselves inside out for at most, a second place.</p>



<p>It is glorious.</p>
