<p><a href="http://andyrutledge.com/news-redux.php">Andy Rutledge: News Redux</a></p><p>Rutledge&#8217;s online news redux has been linked around the internet like crazy this week and is of particular interest to me as someone who works on <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/">a news website</a> for a living.</p>



<p>The most frustrating thing about reading the responses is the way it&#8217;s being treated as nothing more than an unsolicited NY Times redesign. This is not the case:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>As with all of my previous redux efforts, this one is not a specific suggestion for how to precisely redesign a specific site. It’s just an exercise to discuss and examine specific issues via quickly-conceived, hastily-constructed visual comps.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>The comps are just illustrations of his points. Everyone is ignoring this.</p>



<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, I find the NY Times homepage impossible to use. It&#8217;s like staring into a bowl of alphabet soup looking for words. Rutledge&#8217;s comp looks like something I want to use, his points make sense and resonate with me.</p>



<p>Gruber <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/07/27/news-site-design">linked</a> to <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2011/07/designing-a-big-news-site-is-about-more-than-beauty/">a response</a> by Joshua Benton which perfectly demonstrates the thought pattern that creates these shambles in the first place.</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Similarly, stripping stories down to just headlines — no intro text, which Rutledge dislikes for some reason, no thumbnails — may maximize typographic beauty, but it doesn’t do much for enticing a click.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>As Gruber pointed out, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_per_impression">CPM advertising</a> is a disease eating these websites from the inside out. Even at my place of work, a non-commercial operation, a click is valued highly because page visits are considered markers of success. This is the <em>wrong metric</em>. Attention, engagement, satisfaction and loyalty should define success.</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Rutledge’s design, on a commonly sized laptop screen (1440×990), would link to exactly three stories in the first screenful of content. The Times’ current Politics page links to 13.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>People know how to scroll. People can&#8217;t read 13 stories at once. People can&#8217;t click on 13 stories at once. Respect your users by treating them like they know how to use a computer. Treat them like <em>humans</em>. How many stories does the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/images/2011/07/29/nytfrontpage/scan.jpg">print edition of today&#8217;s NY Times</a>  have above the fold (the real one)? <strong>Three</strong>.</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>The Times generates a ton of content every day. Looking at Times Wire, I see 169 stories published just in the past 18 hours — and I don’t believe that’s actually capturing everything that flows through the Times’ blogs and sundry other online spaces.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Having a lot of something is only reason to organise more effectively, and reason against dumping the whole lot in the one place. The NY Time&#8217;s homepage says to me: &#8220;we have <em>a lot</em> of content, too much for us to deal with it, here it all is, <em>you</em> deal with it&#8221;.</p>



<p>Paul Scrivens <a href="http://journal.drawar.com/d/redesigning-and-re-thinking-the-news/">sees it</a>:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Instead of trying to narrow down what content needs to be shown on the homepage, they try to find ways to ensure that all content is shown on the homepage.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Khoi, previous director of design at nytimes.com, ended up <a href="http://www.subtraction.com/2011/07/28/unsolicited-redesigns">responding</a> to the piece but unfortunately dealt with it as nothing more than a redesign, just as everyone else.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll close with something I think is important and for which a trend seems to be starting. Newspapers aren&#8217;t expensive but they&#8217;re not free. Rutledge is all for paid subscriptions, as am I:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Quality news is valuable. It must therefore have a cost. Quality news is subscription only. You pay for valuable information. Fluff you get for free.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Making something people want to buy has been the way newspapers have worked (and <em>flourished</em>) for over 100 years. It&#8217;s baffling why they&#8217;re <a href="http://bradcolbow.com/archive/view/the_brads_this_is_why_your_newspaper_is_dying/">abandoning it</a> <em>to their detriment</em> as soon as they step onto the web.</p>
