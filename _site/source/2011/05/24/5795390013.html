<p>I always found it a bit strange that such a thing would be an explicit criteria on every advertised job vacancy. That was before I entered the workforce. Every day I&#8217;m further astonished by people&#8217;s inability to not just articulate themselves but string a sentence together that makes any sense at all. Combined with a complete lack of brevity I spend so much time either deciphering or slogging through something that can be said with 1/10th the words.</p>
