<blockquote>It is said, however, that the great peaks canâ€™t be reached without crossing through deep valleys. Tragically, we were reminded today that our sport is one of great peaks and deep, deep valleys.</blockquote><p>Frank Strack in a <a href="http://www.velominati.com/blog/in-memoriam/triumph-and-tragedy/">stirring memoriam</a> to Wouter Weylandt&#8217;s death today in stage 3 of the Giro d&#8217;Italia. I would have said that words cannot describe the tragedy of a 26-year-old athlete with an unborn child losing his life this way but Frank&#8217;s come close.</p>



<p>Apparently there are videos of the crash but like many of the commentators, I have no desire to see it. An incredibly sad day.</p>
