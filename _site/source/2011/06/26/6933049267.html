<p>There are three small things that make <a href="http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific">Twitterrific for Mac</a> my choice over the official <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/au/app/twitter/id409789998?mt=12">Twitter for Mac</a>:</p>



<ol><li>Twitterrific does not automatically shorten every URL I post regardless of length. I want people to know what I&#8217;m linking to.</li>

<li>Twitterrific inserts the URL of an uploaded image into the tweet body rather than as an invisible &#8220;attachment&#8221;. I want to choose where my image URL goes.</li>

<li>Twitterrific has an option for turning off the dock icon.</li>

</ol><p>That is all.</p>
