<p>From Jessie Char&#8217;s <a href="http://jessiechar.tumblr.com/post/2927541471" class="tumblr_blog">What Your 16-Hour Workday Says About You!</a>:</p>



<blockquote><ul><li>You’re a <em>really</em> hard worker</li>

<li>Your time is poorly managed</li>

<li>You don’t know what to do with your life</li>

<li>Your boss knows you’re gullible</li>

<li>At least 40% of your diet consists of pre-packaged food</li>

<li>You send out work emails at inappropriate hours</li>

<li>You have no perspective on life</li>

<li>You don’t sleep enough for proper brain function</li>

<li>You have very little self-respect</li>

<li>Your salary should be higher, but isn’t</li>

<li>You drink either too much or not enough </li>

</ul></blockquote>



<p>This couldn&#8217;t be more accurate although I say it applies to a 10-hour as much as a 16-hour workday. &#8220;You have no perspective on life&#8221; is the most striking. Despite years of it not actually working, the workoholics I know seem to be driving themselves into the ground at the expense of <em>everything</em> else as a means to get to some mythical place not even they can discern. I have no respect for these people.</p>
