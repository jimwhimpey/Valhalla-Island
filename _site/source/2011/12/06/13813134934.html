<p>Preface: I&#8217;ve never used <a href="http://gowalla.com/">Gowalla</a> but apparently it&#8217;s a better foursquare (which I also haven&#8217;t used and <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/jimwhimpey/status/138885690032271360">don&#8217;t get</a>).</p>



<p>Anyway, they got <a href="http://blog.gowalla.com/post/13782997303/gowalla-going-to-facebook">bought by Facebook</a> just the other day. MG Siegler <a href="http://parislemon.com/post/13659256377/facebook-buys-gowalla">said</a>:</p>

  <p>Iâ€™m really happy for the Gowalla team.</p>

<p>This <a href="http://twitter.com/wilshipley/status/143851541697265666">seems to be</a> the vibe whenever one of these small companies gets bought by a big company. I say &#8220;vibe&#8221; because I avoid actually following this kind of news and only see reaction to it on Twitter.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;ve started a small company, working with great people (which I would assume because you&#8217;ve hired them), making something great that lots of people enjoy and you&#8217;re making money I can&#8217;t see how getting bought by a huge company would be anything to be happy about.</p>



<p>But I guess that&#8217;s the classic (and ridiculous) problem for these kinds of startups: everything&#8217;s great except they&#8217;re not making money, they have no plan to make money and that can&#8217;t possibly be sustained. I&#8217;d imagine Gowalla would have much preferred to find a way to make money themselves. It&#8217;s bizarre that people would be happy for and congratulate a company for doing the only alternative to eventual bankruptcy at the expense of all their control and identity.</p>
