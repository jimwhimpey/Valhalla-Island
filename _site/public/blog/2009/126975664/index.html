<div class="entry-content"><p>My place of employment is a corporation with a deeply ingrained culture of using Microsoft products. When I started my job I had a temporary PC (until my permanent PC would arrive) and I tried using it. A few weeks in I brought in my disused first generation Macbook, connected it, setup my Exchange email account in Mail and I&#8217;ve been happily and efficiently working away ever since.</p>



<p>Now that Macbook&#8217;s lease is soon to end and I was hoping my employer would fund a Mac, rather than a PC, to replace it. This is an issue of contention. Both my boss and co-workers ask often &#8220;why can&#8217;t you just use Windows?&#8221; After using a PC for many years and now using Mac for many years the difference is crystal clear in my mind yet difficult to quantify and thus, difficult to communicate to people who&#8217;ve never experienced the difference.</p>



<p>Even <a href="http://www.marco.org/26335880">Marco</a>, while making good points brings it down to <em>design</em>, something very difficult quantify. What follows is a list of things you <em>can</em> quantify. It&#8217;s just a selection of features and functionality that ship with or are exclusive to OS X that make using a Mac more pleasant and productive.</p>



<p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotlight_(software)">Spotlight</a></strong>: I use Spotlight to launch apps, find files, notes, emails, people, do calculations and look up dictionary and thesaurus definitions. It&#8217;s instant and integrates perfectly with all applications, including third party applications. It&#8217;s Google for your own data but faster and more accurate.</p>



<p><strong><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/joewhk/3434632507/">Colour labels</a></strong>: I mark files that are currently relevant with red labels, personal projects with blue, old university stuff with purple. If I&#8217;m watching a series of TV shows I&#8217;ll label each one I&#8217;ve watched so I instantly know where I&#8217;m up to when I get back. It&#8217;s not a hack, they appear in every kind of file view, you can create smart folders using them as filters. It&#8217;s one simple solution to many small problems.</p>



<p><strong><a href="http://me.com">MobileMe</a></strong>: I turned on MobileMe (then .Mac) two years ago and it&#8217;s worked invisibly and flawlessly since. It&#8217;s a massively underrated service. I modify a contact&#8217;s details at home, the next day I go to work, it&#8217;s there. I find that contact on my phone, it&#8217;s there. I&#8217;m on a friend&#8217;s computer, I go online and it&#8217;s there. MobileMe is a classic case of having something just work with zero administration.</p>



<p><strong>The System Wide Dictionary</strong>: Across every native application, in every text field, area, control or any slab of text whatsoever, you get the same system wide spell checker and dictionary. You don&#8217;t need to be inside a word processor, spell checking exists the same way in a webpage&#8217;s text fields, your Twitter app, your instant message client, <em>everything</em>.</p>



<p>The system wide dictionary doesn&#8217;t just provide spell checking but hover your mouse over any word in any native application and hit command+option+d for an inline, contextual dictionary definition. The fact this functionality isn&#8217;t available in Air and Flash (because they&#8217;re not native) is one of the many frustrating things about using those applications.</p>



<p><strong><a href="http://archive.valhallaisland.com/blog/2008/dictionary-the-quintessential-mac-application/">The Dictionary Application</a></strong>: OS X ships with a beautiful application that interfaces with the New Oxford American Dictionary, Oxford American Writer&#8217;s Thesaurus, Apple&#8217;s own dictionary of terms and Wikipedia. The app works like a wiki with clicking any word taking you to the definition for that word with linear forward and back navigation. It&#8217;s gorgeously typeset and even <a href="http://archive.valhallaisland.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/picture-16.png">formats Wikipedia articles</a> into a paired-back, more readable format. Like so many other OS X applications, Dictionary also integrates with Spotlight. Every time I come across an unheard of word I I type it into Spotlight, hit enter and read the definition in Dictionary. I use it the same way for thesaurus references over and over again while composing blog posts, email messages and writing documents. (Already I&#8217;ve used it 6 times during this post alone). The time taken between wanting a definition or synonym and getting one is limited only by how fast you can type.</p>



<p><strong>The Command Line and other Unix Things</strong>: I&#8217;m not a huge command line user but having powerful, lower level control of your system is useful and empowering. No matter what an application might tell you, ultimately you&#8217;re in control. Accessing your computer and others remotely with ssh, interacting with tools like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_Ruby_Shell">irb</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launchd">launcd</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL">cURL</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wget">wget</a> and stringing them together with bash scripts can be a lifesaver in some situations, simply fun to play with in others. Otherwise complicated problems can be easily solved with lightweight scripting and the command line. There&#8217;s applications like <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> which are so conceptually complicated and difficult to visualise that text on a command line is simply the most clear and efficient method of interaction.</p>



<p>With the command line your entire system is totally at your disposal. Nothing&#8217;s hidden for your &#8220;safety&#8221; or your own good.</p>



<p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expos%C3%A9_(Mac_OS_X)">Exposé</a></strong>: I rarely used Exposé until I had to use a smaller screen at work, then it became invaluable. There&#8217;s simply no more intuitive method for managing many windows on a single screen.</p>



<p><strong>Drag and Drop</strong>: Just some examples. Drag a file onto an application in the dock and it opens in that application. Drag a snippet of text onto Safari and it performs a Google search with that string. Drag an MP3 onto iTunes and it&#8217;s added to the library. Drag multiple files or a folder onto TextMate and it creates a new project using those files. Drag a file onto Mail and it creates a new email with that file as an attachment. Drag a folder from the Finder into a Terminal window and it inserts the path to that folder. Dragging something but can&#8217;t see the window where you want to drop it? Start dragging, hit an Exposé key, drag it onto the window you want. If your drop destination isn&#8217;t in an open window drill down through folders by hovering until it opens, there&#8217;s no need to prepare windows ready for a drag.</p>



<p>The extent to which drag and drop is integrated into the system is staggering. It&#8217;s totally intuitive and saves a lot of time.</p>



<p><strong><a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/what-is-macosx/quick-look.html">Quick Look</a></strong>: Instantly review a file&#8217;s contents without having to sit through a slow application launch.</p>



<p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preview_(software)">Preview</a></strong>: An instantly launching image viewer and lightweight editor. I use Preview so I don&#8217;t have to open Fireworks or Photoshop to do a simple resize, crop or pick colours from an image. It has more advanced but less frequently used colour adjusting controls. It&#8217;s an app that ships with OS X you take for granted until you&#8217;re on a Windows machine left with MS Paint or the absurdly-named Windows Picture and Fax Viewer as options.</p>



<p><strong><a href="http://guides.macrumors.com/Taking_Screenshots_in_Mac_OS_X">Screenshots</a></strong>: Command+shift+3 takes a full screenshot, command+shift+4 allows you to select an area of the screen, command+shift+4 followed by the spacebar automatically snaps to windows for a clean single window screenshot with shadows. All output PNG files directly and immediately to the desktop, there&#8217;s no need for an image editor, no need for manual post-cropping and no need for exporting. Taking screenshots works how taking screenshots should work.</p>



<p><strong>Natural Language Recognition</strong>: If there&#8217;s anything that looks like a phone number or an address in a Mail.app email message it&#8217;s recognised as one and can be sent to Address Book. If there&#8217;s anything that looks like a date and time in a Mail.app email message it&#8217;s recognised as an event and can be sent to iCal. It&#8217;s something very simple but it saves having to manually transfer data between applications that a computer should be able to take care of.</p>



<p><strong>The Dock</strong>: Not just an application launcher or drag target but a notifier, application controller and organiser. Unread messages, file transfer progress, completed downloads, new instant messages, know what applications are open all at a glance from the Dock. Control applications without having to show the app&#8217;s window. Put anything in there you want quick access to: files, folders or web bookmarks without sullying your desktop.</p>



<p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automator_(software)">Automator</a></strong>: Automator makes repetitive tasks easy to farm out to your computer, who&#8217;s much better at them. Need to crop a bunch of images with the same dimensions? Rename a set of files based on a find and replace? Or extract the text from multiple PDFs? Automator can do it for you.</p>



<p><strong><a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/what-is-macosx/time-machine.html">Time Machine</a></strong>: Backup both a chore and important. I don&#8217;t want to setup backup processes, I don&#8217;t want to have to make sure it works, I don&#8217;t want to have to go through a three hour roll back restore process to get an old version of a file. Until you need it, Time Machine is invisible, when you do need it the process of restoring files is quick, simple and totally painless. It&#8217;s how backup should work.</p>



<p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DigitalColor_Meter">DigitalColor Meter</a></strong>: Pick colours from anything on the screen, hit a shortcut to copy the value to the clipboard. Very few applications have a colour picker built in (and so they shouldn&#8217;t) so a tool that transcends applications and the operating system makes sense. DigitalColor Meter does its sole job so well I&#8217;ll often still use it to pick colours from graphics applications that have their own picker built in.</p>



<p>These are just a few of the tangible parts that make using a computer running OS X a joy. Not because interacting with the OS is a joy but because the OS <em>does it&#8217;s job</em>, letting you spend your time on what you really want to be doing. This is before taking into account the much more important but difficult to quantify experience as a whole. When these great tools and features come together with a consistent, seamless and clearly thought out design the advantage is amplified. Mac OS X is greater than the sum of it&#8217;s parts but even the parts make a pretty good case on their own.</p>
