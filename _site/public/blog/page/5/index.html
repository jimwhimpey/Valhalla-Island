	        <h2 class="entry-title">Helmets</h2>
	      
			
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is an argument that&#8217;s come up over and over again lately as more Australian cities implement public bike hire programs which are failing.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll state my position again: helmets <strong>should not</strong> be compulsory for adults. The kind of riding a casual cyclist commuting on a 30kg public bike does is <em>extremely low risk</em>. It&#8217;s clear helmets are a barrier to more people cycling while similar programs in helmet-less nations have flourished. The more people cycling, the more demand for cycling infrastructure, the more aware and accepting motorists will be of cyclists and the safer cycling becomes for everyone. It&#8217;s simple.</p>



<p>Because I am a glutton for punishment, I read the comments on <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/sport/cycling/blogs/cycling-tips/change-of-tune-20110817-1iwx4.html">articles like this one</a> from Wade Wallace and there are two arguments that infuriate me the most.</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Yes, the bicycles are the sturdy sit-up and beg type, but they are still vulnerable to what you call the biggest threat: traffic. Well, that&#8217;s why I always put my helmet on.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Are we so accustomed to the nanny state that someone would be against a law being repealed because they currently adhere to the law as it makes them feel personally safer? <em>Repealing the law doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;re not allowed to wear a helmet if you want to</em>! Many people would still wear helmets, I would still wear a helmet 99% of the time. Ahh!</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Cycle deaths in Australia are numbered each year in the 100s, in the U.K. they number in the 1000s (and are apparently in the increase). Cycle helmets save lives (lots and lots of them) - simple as that.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>That is not the argument. <em>No one</em> is arguing that you&#8217;re less likely to die in a crash if you&#8217;re not wearing a helmet. The argument is that the net safety gain of having many more bikes and less cars on the road, net general health gains of having more people more active and net environmental and societal gains from quiet, safer, zero emission transportation <em>far</em> outweighs the benefit of having a helmet on by law in bike accident situations which, even if the law was repealed, people would be wearing helmets in <em>anyway</em>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This story seems to me like an incredibly obvious case of missing the point. There is nothing inherent about watching coloured pixels flicker that would cause ill-effects to your health.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s far more likely that sitting for long periods is a problem in which case the fact a TV is on in your line of sight makes no difference. Reading a book or listening to a podcast on the couch would produce the same results. It&#8217;s also likely that high amounts of TV watching is an indicator of less time spent exercising or cooking fresh, healthy meals.</p>



<p>Their conclusion is the equivalent of claiming spending time inside a McDonalds restaurant directly relates to the purchase of plus size clothing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Alex Steffen makes the eloquent case against simply using clean energy to solve our climate problem.</p>



<p>This explains why, even if electric cars were readily available and they could be charged on 100% clean energy I have very little interest in owning one despite not owning a car now partially for environmental reasons. I would much rather (and do) live close to the things I need and want to do. Electric or not, cars are backed up from my house to the city each morning. I pass hundreds of gridlocked cars on my 7 minute bike ride to work, they&#8217;re already unsustainable.</p>



<p>He ends with this great quote:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Because right now our economy by and large operates as Paul Hawkins said by stealing the future, selling it in the present and calling it GDP.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over the weekend I managed to drop my iPhone 4 on concrete before immediately stomping on it just to make sure it was properly smashed. I&#8217;m not too bothered because my contract ends in a month and I would be getting a new iPhone (hopefully an iPhone 5) for no extra money. Until that time I have a borrowed 3GS and some observations:</p>



<ul><li>The screen is <em>horrible</em>. It&#8217;s amazing how quickly I got used to and proceed to take the Retina Display for granted.</li>

<li>The camera is also crappy. The iPhone 4 camera rivals any point and shoot I&#8217;ve ever used, the 3GS camera is a very much a phone camera.</li>

<li>The 3GS hardware doesn&#8217;t look as good as the iPhone 4 hardware but it feels <em>much</em> nicer in the hand.</li>

</ul><p>Those a really the only differences. The 3GS is still a great phone and I can see why Apple is still selling it.</p>

  <p>As with all of my previous redux efforts, this one is not a specific suggestion for how to precisely redesign a specific site. It’s just an exercise to discuss and examine specific issues via quickly-conceived, hastily-constructed visual comps.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>The comps are just illustrations of his points. Everyone is ignoring this.</p>



<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, I find the NY Times homepage impossible to use. It&#8217;s like staring into a bowl of alphabet soup looking for words. Rutledge&#8217;s comp looks like something I want to use, his points make sense and resonate with me.</p>



<p>Gruber <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/07/27/news-site-design">linked</a> to <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2011/07/designing-a-big-news-site-is-about-more-than-beauty/">a response</a> by Joshua Benton which perfectly demonstrates the thought pattern that creates these shambles in the first place.</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Similarly, stripping stories down to just headlines — no intro text, which Rutledge dislikes for some reason, no thumbnails — may maximize typographic beauty, but it doesn’t do much for enticing a click.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>As Gruber pointed out, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_per_impression">CPM advertising</a> is a disease eating these websites from the inside out. Even at my place of work, a non-commercial operation, a click is valued highly because page visits are considered markers of success. This is the <em>wrong metric</em>. Attention, engagement, satisfaction and loyalty should define success.</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Rutledge’s design, on a commonly sized laptop screen (1440×990), would link to exactly three stories in the first screenful of content. The Times’ current Politics page links to 13.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>People know how to scroll. People can&#8217;t read 13 stories at once. People can&#8217;t click on 13 stories at once. Respect your users by treating them like they know how to use a computer. Treat them like <em>humans</em>. How many stories does the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/images/2011/07/29/nytfrontpage/scan.jpg">print edition of today&#8217;s NY Times</a>  have above the fold (the real one)? <strong>Three</strong>.</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>The Times generates a ton of content every day. Looking at Times Wire, I see 169 stories published just in the past 18 hours — and I don’t believe that’s actually capturing everything that flows through the Times’ blogs and sundry other online spaces.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Having a lot of something is only reason to organise more effectively, and reason against dumping the whole lot in the one place. The NY Time&#8217;s homepage says to me: &#8220;we have <em>a lot</em> of content, too much for us to deal with it, here it all is, <em>you</em> deal with it&#8221;.</p>



<p>Paul Scrivens <a href="http://journal.drawar.com/d/redesigning-and-re-thinking-the-news/">sees it</a>:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Instead of trying to narrow down what content needs to be shown on the homepage, they try to find ways to ensure that all content is shown on the homepage.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Khoi, previous director of design at nytimes.com, ended up <a href="http://www.subtraction.com/2011/07/28/unsolicited-redesigns">responding</a> to the piece but unfortunately dealt with it as nothing more than a redesign, just as everyone else.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll close with something I think is important and for which a trend seems to be starting. Newspapers aren&#8217;t expensive but they&#8217;re not free. Rutledge is all for paid subscriptions, as am I:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Quality news is valuable. It must therefore have a cost. Quality news is subscription only. You pay for valuable information. Fluff you get for free.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Making something people want to buy has been the way newspapers have worked (and <em>flourished</em>) for over 100 years. It&#8217;s baffling why they&#8217;re <a href="http://bradcolbow.com/archive/view/the_brads_this_is_why_your_newspaper_is_dying/">abandoning it</a> <em>to their detriment</em> as soon as they step onto the web.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The trailer for what looks like a fascinating movie. The concept:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>In the late 21st century, time has replaced money as the unit of currency. At 25 years old, aging stops and each person is given one more year to live. Unless you replenish your clock, you die.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>You spend time earning more time, buying goods and services costs time. It would certainly change your priorities.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><img src="/assets/tumblr/tumblr_lovwjxdFJT1qzwfbio1_500.jpg"/><br/><p>Cadel Evans, caked in mud, wearing the world champion&#8217;s jersey, winning stage 7 of last year&#8217;s Giro d&#8217;Italia. It was probably participating in that race which most severely hampered his bid for the 2010 yellow jersey.</p>



<p>This year he raced the much more sedate Tour de Romandie (and won) in preparation. This year, his 7th year, at 34 years old, Cadel Evans won the Tour de France.</p>



<p>He is an emotional man who struggles with the spoken word and media attention but whose legs and heart could not have communicated with more clarity over the last three weeks and last two years. His victory and the way he did it fill me with pride as an Australian and cycling fan.</p>
