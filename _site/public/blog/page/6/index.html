  <div class="entry-content"><img src="/assets/tumblr/tumblr_lobk3toUMb1qzwfbio1_500.jpg"/><br/><p>As a cyclist, a cycling fan and an Australian this photo fills me to overflowing with feelings of reverence. It was taken a couple of hundred metres from the finish line of this year&#8217;s Tour de France stage 4 and I can&#8217;t stop looking at it.</p>



<p>Cadel won the stage by a few centimetres by delivering a sustained attack so vicious that neither Alberto Contador, undisputedly the best climber in the world, nor Philippe Gilbert, a man who just months ago swept the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ardennes_classics">Ardennes classics</a> by destroying the rest of the field on uphill finishes exactly like this one, could come around him.</p>



<p>Those faces belong to two of the most dominant men, not only in cycling, but in this specific kind of finish and they are <em>in pain</em>. Not once this year in any of Gilbert&#8217;s destructive Ardennes wins or throughout Contador&#8217;s Giro dominance did they look like <em>that</em>. Cadel, an Australian, is on the front, determination contorting his face and body, forcing <em>the best</em> to turn themselves inside out for at most, a second place.</p>



<p>It is glorious.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote>In the past decade or so, researchers have produced a significant body of research measuring the dreadfulness of a long commute. People with long transit times suffer from disproportionate pain, stress, obesity, and dissatisfaction. The joy of living in a big, exurban house, or that extra income leftover from your cheap rent? It is almost certainly not worth it.</blockquote><p>Slate <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2295603/">states the obvious</a> about the shittiness of long commutes in <em>only</em> 1000 words.</p>



<p>This is why every dollar (of the many) I spend on my apartment, a ~5 minute bike ride from work, is money well spent. Each day I bypass gridlocked traffic on Coronation Drive while cruising along the riverside bikeway. What good is your big house, big backyard or the extra money* in your pocket when so much of the time you could be spending enjoying those things is instead spent in traffic?</p>



<p>Ridiculous beyond belief is the phenomenon of purchasing a luxury car with the money you save by living in the suburbs so the two hours you have to spend in a car each day are more enjoyable. A supreme example of solving the wrong problem.</p>



<p>* When you remove the cost of car ownership (insurance, registration, maintenance), tolls, fuel and parking the perceived increased cost of living is probably false.</p>

	        <h2 class="entry-title">The Truly Silent Phone</h2>
	      
			
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I don&#8217;t like the concept of phones. It shouldn&#8217;t be socially acceptable to interrupt anyone at any time with a demand for their complete attention. That said, situations exist where information is important enough to warrant interruption.</p>



<p>To partly deal with it I rarely had my phone set to anything but silent. In reality &#8220;silent&#8221; mode with vibration on is actually quite loud and jarring, much more jarring than many ringtones and especially if your phone is sitting on a hard surface. Even in a pocket I find the vibration more of a shock than a vibration-less ringtone.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s only recently that I identified anxiety attached my ringing and vibrating phone and the attention it demanded. So I decided that as well as permanent silent mode I&#8217;d turn off vibrate and I haven&#8217;t looked back, it&#8217;s a joy.</p>



<p>If my phone is in view the most notification I get of a call or text is a lit up screen. Much less distracting and more easily ignored than a loud ring or vibrate. If it&#8217;s not in view I get <em>no notification at all</em>. Even when in view I get zero notification of new email, an added bonus.</p>



<p>Sure I miss a lot of calls but in a couple of months it&#8217;s never mattered, people leave a message and can wait until I next check my phone and I&#8217;m free to call. If I&#8217;m expecting a call and my phone isn&#8217;t within peripheral vision I&#8217;ll temporarily turn off silent mode.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a simple change and it may sound dramatic but it feels liberating.</p>

<p>I couldn&#8217;t agree more with the comments Pilgrim quotes. So few people have an inherent desire to pirate and it&#8217;s an accessible option to even less. iTunes &#8220;beat&#8221; piracy by being better. iTunes is easier, faster and more reliable, it&#8217;s simply a more desirable option even to those with the technical acumen to pirate content. With the &#8220;bonus&#8221; of being the ethical option.</p>



<p>As commenter Peter <a href="http://www.davidflanagan.com/2011/04/javascript-the-1.html#comment-2020">points out</a>:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>I have been an OReilly Safari subscriber for several years. I can recommend this to every developer out there. … Yet, must admit it still pains me that for ~$500/year we as honest subscribers can not get the same convenience (offline access, unencumbered PDF’s) as people who just download a pirated PDF library for free.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Piracy doesn&#8217;t &#8220;win&#8221; for books because it&#8217;s free but because it&#8217;s better.</p>
