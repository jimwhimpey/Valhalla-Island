	        <h2 class="entry-title">Rehabilitation Observation</h2>
	      
			
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Situations are always interesting when a random sample of people are brought together and forced to interact. My rehabilitation program is a great example: eight people, half male, half female, discrete age groups, social status, referred from different places and working in a variety of fields.</p>



<p>Something that bothers me is people who complain about problems they can fix but choose not to solve for whatever reason. This kind of person is represented heavily in my group.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m not the typical patient in my program. My back problems have existed for 5 weeks, since breaking my bones, most others have chronic problems that have been around for years or even decades. Invariably back problems can be solved simply â€” with the right exercise, body mechanics, stretching and posture.</p>



<p>Some group members have been attending back and neck rehabilitation programs for years, temporarily solving their problems but relapsing when they get &#8220;too busy&#8221; to keep up their exercise and stretching. It&#8217;s expected that we&#8217;ll continue our floor and cardio exercises for at least an hour a day five times per week when the program is complete. There&#8217;s no one that hasn&#8217;t complained about the burden of having to exercise when they have so little time as it is while simultaneously complaining about back pain, the stress it causes and the things it prevents them doing.</p>



<p>The patient who seems to have the most day to day issues flat out refuses to give up wearing high heeled shoes despite the physio and occupational therapist&#8217;s dire warnings against them. Another just doesn&#8217;t like wearing shoes with good arch support. It blows my mind that these people are willing to enrol in a two week, full-time rehabilitation program but are totally unwilling to wear a different kind of shoe. I can&#8217;t imagine how frustrating it must be for doctors.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not limited to taking care and responsibility for their own well-being either. A consistent topic of conversation is how terrible the traffic is. I talk about how great it is living in the city, so close to the hospital and all other amenities. They turn their nose up, <em>&#8220;I could never live in the city&#8221;</em>. Meanwhile, they&#8217;re spending two hours a day stuck in stop start traffic, complaining bitterly about it and can&#8217;t find a single hour per day to look after their health.</p>



<p>The exercise physiologist asked me whether I&#8217;ll have the time to continue the floor exercise program after the two weeks. Of course I&#8217;ll have time because I rent an apartment very close to my workplace, I work sane hours and getting back to 100% health is <em>the most</em> important thing in my life. Without that, little else, including the type of shoe I wear, matters.</p>

	        <h2 class="entry-title">Minimalism Versus Simplicity</h2>
	      
			
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Often friends or family upon seeing my bedroom or computer setup comment on the &#8220;minimalism&#8221;. That description has never sat well with me. It&#8217;s not until I&#8217;ve started following minimalism blogs like <a href="http://minima.al3x.net/">Minima</a> and <a href="http://minimalmac.com/">Minimal Mac</a> that I&#8217;ve realised why.</p>



<p>What I&#8217;m striving for isn&#8217;t minimalism but simplicity. While simplicity is taking away all but the essentials I feel like minimalism is taking away all but the essentials <em>and then taking away more</em> merely for the sake of less at the cost of utility, convenience or comfort.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote>To me, &#8220;biking&#8221; is a belittling term that evokes fanny packs and hybrids, and I prefer the somewhat more dignified &#8220;cycling.</blockquote>I guess technically the word biking makes sense, there&#8217;s many other activities named the same way: skateboarding, trucking, roller blading, etc. Biking and biker still sounds gross to me, as if it&#8217;s the equivalent of calling walking shoeing.

	        <h2 class="entry-title">The Ride to Cure Diabetes</h2>
	      
			
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Early next year I&#8217;m taking part in the <a href="http://ride.jdrf.org.au/default.asp">Ride to Cure Diabetes</a>. It&#8217;s a 160km ride through the hills of the Barossa Valley in South Australia. To be eligible to participate I need to raise $3500. I&#8217;ve setup <a href="http://ride.jimwhimpey.com/">a website</a> to collect donations, chart my progress, explain what Juvenile Diabetes is, why I&#8217;m doing it and why you should donate.</p>



<p>My sister was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes when she was 12 years old and I&#8217;ve seen first hand how it can affect a young person&#8217;s life. Type 1 Diabetes is treatable but it&#8217;s a heavy burden for a child to hold when the complications can be so severe. The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, the charity behind the ride to cure, are solely dedicated to finding a cure for Type 1 Diabetes. They don&#8217;t waste money on &#8220;awareness raising&#8221;, every donation goes towards the research that will eventually find a cure.</p>



<p>While the main purpose of riding is to raise funds for JDRF, recovering from <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/141205452">my bike accident</a> a little over a month ago is secondary. 160km through hilly terrain is an intimidating thought while my bike is <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/142504150">crushed</a> and 18 of my bones remain broken but it&#8217;s a goal that will only aid my recovery.</p>



<p>Donations are handled through <a href="http://ride.jdrf.org.au/teamParticipant.asp?participantID=35">my page at JDRF</a> but you can find more information and a cool graph I&#8217;ll be continually updating at <a href="http://ride.jimwhimpey.com/">my own fundraising website</a>. I&#8217;ll be hugely grateful for donations of any amount. If you run a business and would like a sponsorship arrangement I&#8217;m open to anything, contact me at <a href="mailto:jimwhimpey@me.com">jimwhimpey@me.com</a>. Thank you!</p>

	        <h2 class="entry-title">Radtech&#8217;s Full Screen Noise Filter</h2>
	      
			
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I prefer a glossy screen over matte for the rich colour and super brightness. If it&#8217;s up to me, which it usually is, I&#8217;m not computing in a brightly lit area so glare and reflections are not an issue. At work however it&#8217;s not up to me, the bright fluorescent lighting is unavoidable and when using a glossy screen there&#8217;s glare and reflections.</p>



<p>To combat the glare at work I bought a <a href="http://www.radtech.us/Products/ClearCal-Displays.aspx">ClearCal Anti-Glare film from Radtech</a> and it arrived today. I spent 5 minutes going through the (expectedly) painful process of applying it to the screen, left it on for five minutes, then peeled it off and threw it in the bin.</p>



<p>It no doubt killed the glare but with it was a fine layer of distortion or noise covering the screen making everything slightly blurry and making text difficult to read. A co-worker likened it to removing the anti-aliasing from everything on the screen. It looked <em>terrible</em> and gave me a headache. I tried to tell myself to just live with it for a day or two and allow myself to potentially warm to it but I couldn&#8217;t, it had to go.</p>



<p>The one positive to come from it was that as far as screen problems go, now the glare doesn&#8217;t seem so bad.</p>

	        <h2 class="entry-title">Improving by the Day</h2>
	      
			
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s hard to believe it&#8217;s been a month since <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/141205452">my accident</a>. It still feels like yesterday I was breathing the stifling air of the Princess Alexandra Hospital.</p>



<p>My recovery has been rapid and feels like it accelerates every day. I&#8217;m moving less cautiously and more freely, getting stronger and feeling less tired all the time.</p>



<p>Both my orthopaedic and maxillo facial outpatients appointments have gone well. The doctors are happy with my progress.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve been back at work this past week, not full time but close to it. I handled it well except for Tuesday when I got extremely tired early and was useless for half the day. My boss has been giving me a ride to work each morning but I had the stamina to walk home the last three afternoons. Both being at work and walking home has done the world of good.</p>



<p>The only situation where my back continues to give me any pain is after lying down for hours. I can sleep for a couple of hours totally pain free but any longer than that and it starts to get more than uncomfortable. The only thing that can relieve it is standing or sitting up. I was getting up 3 or 4 times a night but lately it&#8217;s down to the once and the pain is low enough to sleep through most of the time. A week ago I&#8217;d be dying to get out of bed in the morning to relieve the pressure but now I&#8217;m able to hang around for a while. The difference sleeping better makes is huge.</p>



<p>My jaw is gradually getting stronger. I&#8217;m eating food with a little more substance now. I can eat a whole banana normally and can bite through a piece of chocolate if I suck on it for a little while. The more I work it the stronger it gets but I won&#8217;t be anywhere near eating properly until the bones are fully healed in another two and a half weeks.</p>



<p>My teeth still feel a little strange and I&#8217;m sure once the wire is taken out of my mouth in a bit over week I&#8217;m going to lose at least one tooth but I&#8217;ll deal with that then.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m hitting the scars across my face and neck with chlorsig twice a day without fail and it&#8217;s paying dividends. I still have no feeling at all down my nose and around the centre of my mouth. I can feel the nerves rebuilding themselves through the extreme itchiness that no scratching can appease. It seems feeling is creeping back into those areas.</p>



<p>In another week I start a back and neck rehabilitation program at the Wesley Hospital, just a block and a half from my apartment. It&#8217;s a thorough and intensive two week, full time program involving physiotherapists, occupational therapists, neurologists and psychiatrists. It&#8217;s supposed to be the best program available for rehabilitating my kind of injuries and is very expensive but thankfully covered by insurance.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m getting to the point where basic movement is no longer a problem and I&#8217;m itching to do more. Right up until the day of the accident I was running, riding or swimming at least an hour a half a day. That&#8217;s been followed by a month of almost complete inactivity. I&#8217;m looking forward to the rehab program because it&#8217;ll get me moving again with the medical supervision to make sure I don&#8217;t do any further damage to myself.</p>



<p>At the end of those two weeks my bones will be healed, I&#8217;ll be physically active and if not back to 100% strength I&#8217;ll be well on my way to complete recovery.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s great to see Lance back and take a spot on the podium but as a whole this year&#8217;s tour has not been satisfying. Cycling&#8217;s most <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/150702992">ungrateful and plainly disrespectful child</a> took the yellow while Cadel Evans once again languished behind a less than supportive, let alone strong team.</p>



<p>In 2010 I want to see an Australian sponsored team, based in Australia and staffed by Australian cyclists. We have a huge amount of talent but it&#8217;s dispersed between a myriad of European teams. I&#8217;d love to see a team made up primarily of Mick Rogers, Mark Renshaw, Stuart O&#8217;Grady, Heinrich Haussler, Brett Lancaster and Robbie MCewen with Cadel Evans at the helm. It&#8217;s a formidable bunch. Riding not only for their team but for their country might just be enough to give Cadel the support and motivation he needs to take home the yellow jersey.</p>



<p>I want to see the Cervelo Test Team back for their second year with Sastre in Contador-challenging form this time. The battle between Thor Hushovd and Mark Cavendish for the green jersey this year was spectacular, I hope the rivalry continues next year.</p>



<p>And finally I&#8217;m eagerly anticipating the full <a href="http://www.teamradioshack.com/getready/">Team RadioShack</a> lineup. Whoever they get I&#8217;m looking forward to them really sticking it to a Contador-lead team (if there&#8217;s anyone left who wants to call the selfish brat a team mate) next year.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This morning I sent live my first redesign since switching to Tumblr. I don&#8217;t want to talk too much about it except to point out the list of my personal favourite posts in the sidebar. The idea was blatantly ripped off <a href="http://www.marco.org/">Marco</a>.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I remember not enjoying the Harry Potter movies I had seen but after getting my movies up to date with the books I&#8217;ve read over the past few days I realised what&#8217;s missing.</p>



<p>Each Harry Potter book has a primary plot, whatever&#8217;s in the title, The Prisoner of Azkaban, The Goblet of Fire, etc. Problem is, the main story isn&#8217;t all that interesting. What is interesting is the day to day life of witches and wizards. I care little about fighting dementors but I&#8217;m intrigued by the invisibility cloak. The constrained format of a feature film means less time on the superfluous albeit interesting details.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote>Now, I have nothing against cars. Actually, I like cars. They can be useful and fun. Unfortunately, the problem is that many people who operate cars don&#8217;t realize they&#8217;re operating machines, and this is because cars have become so coddling that operating one requires only slightly more effort than watching the Tour de France on your sofa in a state of semi-consciousness while wearing a pair of adult diapers. Yes, the roads are full of bloated vehicles driven by people who need interior microclimates and crow&#8217;s nest vantage points and nine airbags and DVD players to distract their kids and 70-point monitoring systems to keep them awake. Meanwhile, some people think the answer is more efficient cars or alternative energy sources. I strongly disagree. The answer is legislation requiring that all cars have manual transmissions, no airbags, and carbeurated, air-cooled engines with no more than 1500cc displacement. That way, people would actually need to know how to drive, and they&#8217;d also have to pay attention to what they were doing.</blockquote>I couldn&#8217;t agree more with (most of) <a href="http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2009/07/simplify-less-is-less.html">Bike Snob&#8217;s stance on cars</a>.

	        <h2 class="entry-title">Alternative iPhone Ringtones</h2>
	      
			
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m not one to fuck around with ringtones on my phone. I choose the closest sound to a real ringing phone and leave it at that forever. But as more people get iPhones more people are using that same ringtone.</p>



<p>iTunes supports creating and buying ringtones made of songs but that&#8217;s not for me, I don&#8217;t associate songs with a ringing phone and don&#8217;t want to.</p>



<p>Turns out if you have iLife installed on your Mac there&#8217;s a rich vein of relatively unique and very much ringtone-like audio loops right on your computer. Navigate to <code>/Library/Audio/Apple Loops/Apple/iLife Sound Effects/Jingles</code>. In there you&#8217;ll find a bunch of loops which by default will open in Apple Loops Utility but can also be played in Quicktime. You can also quickly listen to a bunch by opening the music and sound effects pane and navigating to that folder in iMovie. My favourites are the broadcast news series, flurry, harbor, heroes and the pastel series.</p>



<p>To get them on your iPhone open them in Quicktime and export them as mp3 or aiff files.  Then I used the very simple and straight-forward <a href="http://www.ambrosiasw.com/utilities/itoner/">iToner</a> to transfer those files to the phone as ringtones. After syncing they&#8217;ll appear in your ringtone selection list on the phone under the custom heading. Unfortunately custom ringtones aren&#8217;t supported for message tones.</p>
