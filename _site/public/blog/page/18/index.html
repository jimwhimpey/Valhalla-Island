  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I <em>know</em> it&#8217;s obvious what&#8217;s wrong with this but I can&#8217;t help but talk about it, I&#8217;m <em>facinated</em>.</p>



<p>As a customer this would do nothing but annoy me. You&#8217;re trying to buy a computer and every member of the <em>huge</em> staff breaks out into a repetitive dance for <em>4 minutes</em>. I understand a computer is a big purchase but imagine trying to buy a sandwich and having the cashier dance for even <em>10 seconds</em>. It would be maddening, in both situations.</p>



<p>Speed and service are the qualities I appreciate in a retail store. Microsoft is trying to be fun, a quality no one cares about when buying things (and which Microsoft fails to achieve with their embarrassing dance <em>anyway</em>), at the expense of both.</p>



<p>From what I can see, Microsoft spends 5% of it&#8217;s resources developing a shitty operating system and the remaining 95% on ill conceived ideas to convince people to buy it anyway.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve said similar things <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/194962900">before</a>. Even if Windows seemed like a decent piece of software, I would be wary of it knowing that the <em>same company</em> thinks pulling ridiculous shit like Windows 7 launch parties and dance routines in its stores are a good idea.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: This post includes an embedded table which lacks styles when viewed in the dashboard but which I&#8217;ve meticulously styled for <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/244183453">the post when viewed on the website</a>, I suggest you view it there.</em></p>



<p>I&#8217;m obsessed with the ideal setup. I try to milk the best out of the equipment I have and think a lot about how it could be improved as my situation changes and new technology is released.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve been more than satisfied with my 24&#8221; iMac at home for a long time but I feel like I&#8217;ve <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/194075509">outgrown it</a>. The Mac Pro was the next, extremely expensive, logical step. Until the 27&#8221; iMac arrived:</p>

</tr></table><p>Equivalent CPU power and (I guess) video cards, the iMac wins on RAM and hard disk space which are both cheap enough to be negligible. So as far as computer specifications go, they&#8217;re <em>very</em> similar, if not totally equivalent out of the box.</p>



<p>The iMac comes with a gorgeous, 27&#8221; LED backlit screen the likes of which you can&#8217;t even buy individually. The Mac Pro comes with no screen. The Mac Pro is expandable with PCI cards and hard disk slots. The cost of that expandability is $1900 and the best computer screen available.</p>



<p>For many the lack of expandability is a deal breaker. If expandability is not essential, the iMac is an easy choice and I imagine many Mac Pro users will defect to the iMac come upgrade time.</p>



<p>Expandability is not essential for me but it&#8217;s desirable. Evidently Apple is able to sell a computer with the power of the Mac Pro for much less than $4,499. I wish they&#8217;d put it in the Mac Pro&#8217;s expandable case and sell it at or below the iMac&#8217;s fantastic price.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><img src="/assets/tumblr/tumblr_kt3mqvgTDG1qzwfbio1_500.jpg"/><br/><p>After seeing the irresistible <a href="http://movies.apple.com/movies/wb/watchmen/watchmen-tlr2_720p.mov">Watchmen trailer (720p .mov)</a> I saw the movie soon after it was released in cinemas. It didn&#8217;t live up to my extremely high expectations but that&#8217;s not to say I didn&#8217;t enjoy it.</p>



<p>Still, every so often I go back to the trailer and want to see the movie again. A friend from work lent me the novel and I loved it, much more than I remember enjoying the movie.</p>



<p>Today I watched the movie again. I had a greater appreciation and better understanding having seen it once before and read the novel but it still didn&#8217;t live up to its potential. Watchmen is an intricate and complex story, the movie leaves a significant amount of that out, which is definitely fine but it then adds fat elsewhere.</p>



<p>One thing the movie did get right is the opening credits. In five minutes it completely covers the background story in a series of gorgeous slow motion scenes. It&#8217;s beautifully succinct in a way the rest of the movie is not.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s <a href="http://static.jimwhimpey.com/images/rorschach.jpg">another great still from the sequence</a> and I&#8217;ve cut <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0VmXfGHG_A">an HD version of the opening credits</a> at YouTube.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have avoided <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a> for <em>so</em> long. It reeks of people who think schmoozing and fortnightly &#8220;networking breakfasts&#8221; are the way to the top, a culture I actively avoid.</p>



<p>This afternoon it was the only search result for a person I was looking for. On their LinkedIn profile was a contact link. Contacting someone requires an account.</p>



<p>Already annoying but this is my only option. I resolve to sign up, email them and close my account. Signing up is a long, multiple step process that involves email activation. After logging in I have to skip my way through a number of information harvesting, data entry screens.</p>



<p>I find the guy I&#8217;m after and look for his email address. Not an option. I can send an &#8220;InMail&#8221;. I try to send an &#8220;InMail&#8221;. Not an option, to send an InMail I need to <strong>upgrade my account</strong>.</p>



<p>For the low price of $25/month I can send 3 &#8220;InMails&#8221;.</p>



<p>No. Fucking. Way.</p>



<p>I delete my account. My avoidance was well founded.</p>



<p>Please, everyone, buy <em>yourname</em>.com, put your email address on it and stop bullshit like LinkedIn dominating a search for your name. It&#8217;s bad for you, bad for people looking for you and good for the scumbags at LinkedIn.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I couldn&#8217;t believe it this morning watching 7 Early News that <a href="http://www.forbes.com/2009/11/08/iphone-virus-attack-technology-security-rickrolling-cybersecurity.html">this</a> was being reported as an iPhone virus with no more qualification than that. It requires three things:</p>



<ol><li>A jail broken phone.</li>

<li>OpenSSH installed, not a default on most jail broken phones.</li>

<li>The default root password.</li>

</ol><p>So about 0.1% of iPhones whose users have gone out of their way to open up completely but haven&#8217;t taken the care to change their password are susceptible. Meanwhile every iPhone owner is under the impression their phones are vulnerable.</p>



<p>Don&#8217;t let the truth get in the way of a good story. Not that anyone having their iPhone background set to a picture of Rick Astley is a good story.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>At work we have very short, golf-green-like carpet, a putting machine and a broken putter. I went to <a href="http://www.cashconverters.com.au/">Cash Converters</a>, one of Australia&#8217;s second hand store chain to buy a replacement club. My only requirement was that it be functional, my budget was roughly $10.</p>



<p>As second hand stores do, they had many putters. About 15 of them and not one was on sale for less than $40 despite most looking very crappy and very used, exactly what I was after.</p>



<p>I looked around the store, a rack of DVDs, a couple of guitars, a cabinet of jewellery, 4 staff and no customers â it was sparse. Meanwhile every story I&#8217;ve heard is that Cash Converters brutally low balls on everything you try to sell them.</p>



<p>Sites like Craigslist, Gumtree, The Trading Post and Ebay are evidence there is a massive market for second hand goods. Yet Cash Converters, what should be the physical manifestation of these websites, stagnates with barely any stock and ridiculously high prices.</p>



<p>If they were willing to reduce their margins Cash Converters would make a great place. I&#8217;m perpetually unloading stuff I don&#8217;t use anymore, I&#8217;d love a place I could take it all at once and get a fair price, albeit a lower price than I&#8217;d get with the hassle of listing it, fielding enquiries and shipping it myself. As a consumer I&#8217;d love a place I could go to get something inconsequential like a putter for cheap. It feels like a huge missed opportunity.</p>

It&#8217;s my favourite, hand picked desktop wallpaper always at high resolution. It&#8217;s kind of like <a href="http://prettify.tumblr.com/">Prettify</a> and <a href="http://www.iconpaper.org/">Iconpaper</a> but without the icons and without all the wallpaper I don&#8217;t like.</p>



<p>I know if you&#8217;re using your computer properly it should rarely be seen but desktop wallpaper is still important. There&#8217;s a lot of great stuff out there but it&#8217;s buried in a sea of rubbish, A Solid Base is your filter. I&#8217;ve loaded it up with a bunch to begin with and have many more lined up in the queue. Enjoy and submit, if you like.</p>

	        <h2 class="entry-title">Streaming HD video from your Mac to your Xbox 360</h2>
	      
			
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have HD video on my computer. I have an Xbox 360 capable of playing video connected to my HDTV. I even have an <a href="http://www.nullriver.com/products/connect360">application</a> that will stream video from my computer to my Xbox over a local network. You&#8217;d think getting HD video to stream from your computer to your Xbox would be easy. It&#8217;s not and I&#8217;m loathed to spend money on another device. I&#8217;ve spent this last weekend trying to make it happen. I found a process that&#8217;s not ideal but it&#8217;ll do.</p>



<h3>The Problem</h3>



<ul><li>The Xbox will not play video in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matroska">Matroska</a> container, the most common format for HD video distribution.</li>

<li>MKV video can be converted to a format the Xbox can read but it can take days of computing power and produce massive files.</li>

<li>Transferring files via physical hard disk is slow and a pain in the ass.</li>

</ul><h3>The Good News</h3>



<p>The Xbox can play H264 video, which is the format of the video inside the Matroska container, it&#8217;s the audio format that the Xbox doesn&#8217;t like. Using Quicktime we&#8217;re able to pass through the video, convert the audio to something the Xbox likes and package it up in an MPEG-4 container. The video is identical, the file size equivalent and the process only takes 10â15 minutes.</p>



<h3>How It&#8217;s Done</h3>



<ol><li>Open the MKV video in QuickTime Pro 7. QuickTime X will not do it (exactly why requires a <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/reviews/2009/08/mac-os-x-10-6.ars/16">long, detailed explanation</a>).</li>

<li>Let the loading bar totally buffer, it takes 5-10 minutes.</li>

<li>File â Export</li>

<li>Choose Movie to MPEG-4 in the drop down.</li>

<li>Click Options.</li>

<li>Choose MP4 from the File Format drop down, <em>not</em> MP4 (ISMA).</li>

<li>Choose Pass Through from the Video Format drop down. If Pass Through is greyed out go back to the video, Window â Show Movie Properties, and deselect the subtitles channel. Try again.</li>

<li>On the Audio tab choose AAC-LC (Music) from the Audio Format drop down. Fill the rest with whatever you like, I use 160kbps, Mono, 44.100khz and &#8220;Best&#8221;.</li>

<li>Click OK, export the file.</li>

<li>It should take 10â15 minutes depending on your processor power, if it&#8217;s taking hours you&#8217;re converting the video too and doing it wrong.</li>

</ol><h3>The Bad News</h3>



<p>The Xbox refuses to play any file too big. Too big seems weigh in at something around 4GB but I&#8217;ve managed to play files a little larger than 4GB. The totally useless error message the Xbox displays when it refuses to play these files makes it seem your video is in the wrong format, it&#8217;s not, cut the video a little shorter and it plays fine.</p>



<p>To get around this insane limitation I&#8217;ve had success using <a href="http://likelysoft.com/splitfuse/">SplitFuse</a> to break a movie up into two, less-than-4GB parts. It takes another 5 or 10 minutes and is another step in the already too long chain but it works.</p>



<h3>Notes</h3>



<p>Steady playback is very hit or miss for me. Sometimes I&#8217;ll go an hour with no hiccups, other times video won&#8217;t play 20 seconds without stalling. Pausing for a time seems to help but not always. I am streaming with an ordinary router over the G protocol between rooms, so the connection is far from the fastest a local network could be. I&#8217;m sure playback would be much more reliable through an Airport Extreme or a wired network.</p>



<p>The process is long, impossible to automate and no where near as convenient or reliable as downloading iTunes content to an Apple TV. But you already have a device capable of playing HD content through your TV and the result at the end of it all is fantastic.</p>
