Snow Leopard broke Wide Mail and <a href="http://barebones.com/products/yojimbo/">YoJimbo 2</a> broke the hack with no new option to replace the need for a hack.</p>



<p>They&#8217;re two of my most used applications, two of the small group I keep running all the time. It&#8217;s really disrupted my computing experience. The item list on item view layout is so <em>inefficient</em> and contrary to the conceptual sense it makes to drill down from left to right.</p>



<p><a href="http://www.newsgator.com/INDIVIDUALS/NETNEWSWIRE/">NetNewsWire</a> defaults to the inferior layout but provides vastly superior options. I&#8217;m surprised Mail in Snow Leopard and YoJimbo 2 have persisted with the obviously inferior layout and no option to correct it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve finally finished the traditional OS X major release review from John Siracusa at Ars Technica. It&#8217;s extremely long and split into a frustrating, <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a>-unfriendly 23 (!) pages but finish it knowing there&#8217;s no need to read another article on the subject. As always it&#8217;s written in a narrative style with a number of high quality visual aids.

A never ridden, 2006, Trek Madone sporting the Dura-Ace 7800 groupset. It&#8217;s the kind of bike pros are still riding today and it was just luck and good timing that I was able to get it at a price within my budget. It was clear after only riding it the 5km home from the bike store that it&#8217;s lightyears ahead of anything I&#8217;ve ridden before.</p>



<p>For now I&#8217;m using quite a high raised stem to slowly ease my spine back into cycling.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last night I saw a friend&#8217;s band play over an hour away down the coast. I didn&#8217;t get home until after midnight but had to wake up at my usual 6am for work. Usually I get to bed at around 8.30 or 9pm and get a solid 9 hours sleep. Usually I go through 4 or 5 spells each day of uncontrollable yawning with a feeling of extreme tiredness and I never feel fully rested or as alert as I did today, after only 5 and a half hours sleep.</p>



<p>Amount of sleep to feeling of being rested is a parabolic function. Two hours too little or two hours too much, you&#8217;re just as tired all day. 9 hours is much more each night than anyone else I know, I&#8217;m going to start going to bed later to feel better rested with the bonus of an hour or two extra each day to get things done.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>From the day I signed up for Twitter almost three years ago I used <a href="http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific">Twitterrific</a>. A few months ago when <a href="http://www.atebits.com/tweetie-mac/">Tweetie</a> was released I made the switch. It was a small learning curve but up until I recently switched back to Twitterrific, I&#8217;d totally forgotten about the differences. The most notable one and reason I switched to Tweetie in the first place is the behaviour that immediately follows an update.</p>



<p>Twitterrific clears the input field and not until the next timeline refresh is your tweet displayed. Tweetie posts it instantly to your timeline. One makes you question whether your tweet has been posted, the other provides instant satisfaction.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote>One thing that was very clear after all these conversations about phones is that there is no “one size fits all” in this market.

Why would any one person not want one of those? There&#8217;s no downside.

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Almost once a day <a href="http://minimalmac.com/">Minimal Mac</a> features a post about how to cut stuff out of your menu bar. The most common removal is the time and date, then replaced by <a href="http://www.machinecodex.com/dateline/index.php">DateLine</a>, a timeline style calendar that sits permanently on and spans the entire desktop. How that scores more minimalism points than the current date a click away in the menu bar, iCal or the dashboard, I don&#8217;t know.</p>



<p>Beside that, applications running in the menu bar has got to be the most unobtrusive, &#8216;minimalist&#8217; option. I&#8217;ve seen unwieldy menu bars but the problem isn&#8217;t the menu bar, it&#8217;s running unused applications. Hiding the dock? Easy. Getting every icon off your desktop? Easy. Minimal Mac&#8217;s assault on the menu bar is minimalism for the sake of minimalism at the expense of utility and convenience.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Commercial television in Australia is saturated with ads for two products: cars and universities. <a href="http://www.griffith.edu.au/">Griffith University</a> releases a new advertising campaign every six months and runs it into the ground. <a href="http://www.uq.edu.au/">UQ</a>, <a href="http://www.qut.edu.au/">QUT</a> and <a href="http://www.bond.edu.au/index.htm">Bond</a> do the same. They don&#8217;t limit themselves to TV commercials, the campaign is spread across billboards, buses and stadium advertising. It must cost a lot of money.</p>



<p><a href="http://www.lambdassociates.org/blog/decline.htm">Dr Mark Tarver</a> has seen it first hand as a student and then a professor in Britain and I&#8217;ve experienced it as a student in Australia. Universities are far less about education than they are about making money. They&#8217;re not schools, they&#8217;re businesses selling an &#8216;education&#8217; product but they&#8217;re even doing a bad job of <em>that</em>.</p>



<p>Like so many other businesses: PC makers and phone manufacturers, every car manufacturer, they have it backwards. Start with a shitty, out-dated campus, facilities and program, then reverse your unappealing experience and poor reputation by spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on saturation advertising.</p>



<p>Mount Royal College, the university I attended in Calgary was an incredible place. It was a beautiful, modern campus and residence that featured manicured sports fields, tennis courts, volley ball courts and a huge, olympic-class gym unlike any I have ever seen before or since. The gym included three indoor basketball courts, an indoor running track, an indoor 25 metre pool, hot tub, steam room, 8 squash courts, a climbing wall and a floor full of new, well maintained weight and cardio equipment. The cost to use these facilities for students: $0. It&#8217;s impossible to find equivalent facilities, university or otherwise, in my city no matter how much money you&#8217;re willing to spend. Facilities half as good cost $800/year.</p>



<p>Compare that with the gym facilities at Griffith University&#8217;s largest campus. A 40m2 room with very little, out-dated equipment. The cost to students already paying $3000+ each semester: $100. The difference in gym facilities is a perfect subset of the greater differences betweens schools here and overseas, particularly in North America.</p>



<p>Before you even think about education, Mount Royal is a place you want to be a part of. They start with great facilities and let natural appeal and reputation take care of the marketing. Rather than blow every last dollar on advertising, money is spent on what must be the far more satisfying task of creating a great place to work and study. Both lure students, one has the bonus of happy, involved student body. It&#8217;s no coincidence that the teaching and instruction I received at Mount Royal was also superior and my fellow students were more interested and studious.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m sure schools like Harvard and Yale in the USA don&#8217;t spend a dime on advertising. They&#8217;ve built a reputation for quality in all areas. They didn&#8217;t win that reputation through relentless advertising campaigns.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/sharks_vs_cats">Sharks vs. Cats</a></p><p>When I first saw the cool avatar modification in my dashboard I couldn&#8217;t wait put my weight behind sharks or cats. But it&#8217;s not that simple, I can&#8217;t decide. I&#8217;m definitely not a cat person, they&#8217;re rude, selfish and exploit their owners. Sharks on the other hand make swimming in the ocean life threatening and eat <a href="http://peetiro.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/baby-seal1.jpg">seals</a>, the dogs of the ocean. Both options are equally unappealing, I can&#8217;t choose.</p>

<p>I remember seeing Brant Webb and Todd Russell striding out of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaconsfield_Mine_collapse">Beaconsfield Mine</a> after 14 nights trapped in a their tiny underground cage. How they were able survive let alone come out looking so fresh and with such high spirits still amazes me.</p>
