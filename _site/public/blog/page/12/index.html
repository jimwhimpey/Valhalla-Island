  <div class="entry-content"><p>An English couple are <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/07/06/2945557.htm">under fire for letting kids cycle to school</a>. It&#8217;s a 1500m route along footpaths that the parents have taught their children. The most &#8220;dangerous&#8221; part involves crossing one road manned by a lollipop lady.</p>



<p>Needless to say, this is madness. I started cycling to school from grade 2 and I still remember the liberation I felt being able to ride to school and friend&#8217;s houses. There was a huge bike lockup at my primary school which was always filled to the brim with bikes.</p>



<p>Ironically, it&#8217;s the convoy of automobiles carrying one child each and the infrastructure to support it at the expense of safer bike and pedestrian facilities that make such independence at all dangerous to begin with. No primary school kid wearing a helmet is going to die in even a bike on bike accident. I fell off my bike more times than I can remember riding to and from school, a little road rash does nothing but teach kids how to deal with crises, albeit small ones, independently.</p>



<p>It seems that even in the 12 years since I was in primary school such freedom has been eradicated. I&#8217;d be very interested to go back to my primary school to see how full the bike rack is now.</p>

	        <h2 class="entry-title">iOS 4 Let Down</h2>
	      
			
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>There were <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/717434547">four new features</a> I was looking forward to in iOS. Unfortunately the iPhone 3G only gets two of them.</p>



<p>The 3G doesn&#8217;t have the power to support multi-tasking so the fast app switching widget isn&#8217;t included, unfortunately the iPhone orientation lock is part of the fast app switching widget and also excluded. Bluetooth keyboard support just isn&#8217;t there.</p>



<p>Worse than the missing features I was most looking forward to is the slow down of the system in general. This release has obviously erred on the side of providing a better experience to the more powerful 3GS and 4.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s one feature of one application which has particularly suffered. Unfortunately it&#8217;s my favourite feature of my most used iPhone application: tilt scrolling in <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a>. Under iOS 4 it&#8217;s severely jaggy with none of the fine control available under iPhone OS 3.</p>



<p>With any luck it won&#8217;t be too long until iPhone 4 is brought to Australia and I can retire my ageing iPhone 3G.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For six years Flickr has had the same frustratingly insufficient photo pages and navigation between them. Two months after I <a href="http://darkroom.heroku.com">create my own thing to address the problem</a> Flickr fixes every issue natively. Albeit currently as an opt-in beta.</p>



<p>At first I wasn&#8217;t worried, the default size was still too small and navigation was still too slow. Then I saw the incredible zoom option with big photos, dark background, super fast keyboard navigation and loading times. It completely blows Darkroom away and it&#8217;s available on every kind of Flickr output.</p>



<p>My happiness as a Flickr user outweighs my disappointment as Darkroom developer.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>My iPhone 3G is starting to show its age. The home button is hard to press properly and there&#8217;s some scuffs on the screen but mostly the software, especially third party software, feels slow.</p>



<p>Luckily my iPhone 3G contract ends in August so I&#8217;ll be able to pick up the iPhone 4 not too long after it&#8217;s released without having to pay any more than I do now. Besides a massive speed jump (same processor as the iPad but <em>double</em> the RAM!) iPhone 4 will unlock a few iOS features not available to older iPhones. Here&#8217;s the new features I&#8217;m most looking forward to:</p>



<ul><li>Spell check. Often on the iPhone I&#8217;ll find myself guessing letters, deleting and guessing again until the autocomplete kicks in to spell a word I don&#8217;t know how to spell. A real spell checker is better.</li>

<li>Blue tooth keyboard support. This is <em>awesome</em>. I used to use <a href="http://mirasoftware.com/BPE2/">BluePhoneElite</a> to send text messages through my phone from my computer. Typing out even an average length message on an iPhone sucks when you&#8217;ve got a keyboard in front of you. I&#8217;m interested to see how this will work with a Bluetooth keyboard already paired with a computer, ideally there&#8217;d be a switch to flip pairing.</li>

<li>Screen orientation lock. It doesn&#8217;t bother me that it&#8217;s only a software switch because I&#8217;ll turn it on and never turn it off again.</li>

<li>All in one Mail inbox. Long overdue.</li>

</ul><p>Judging by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/scobleizer/4695267529/sizes/o/">this</a> it looks like one of my top three iPhone activities — reading Instapaper articles — is going to be vastly improved. I can&#8217;t wait to actually see it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote>Part of this is because stupid people say things that aren’t true, things that aren’t true don’t make sense, and things that don’t make sense are hard to understand. But you can also look at it from the other end: if you genuinely understand something — really, truly understand it — then it doesn’t seem complicated and you can explain it rather simply.</blockquote><p><a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/soundsmart">Aaron Swartz</a> sounding very smart with his beautifully clear explanation of the &#8220;you sound smart&#8221; paradox.</p>



<p>This is exactly the situation I&#8217;m facing while I try to read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_Jest">Infinite Jest</a>. I have this preconceived notion that David Foster Wallace was an extremely smart man but every message, nay, <em>every scene</em> in the book so far seems buried underneath a mountain of long, obscure words mashed together in barely decipherable sentences.</p>

The entire bottom section is unnecessary. Part of the print&#8217;s original appeal was the lack of branding but the useless eyesore of a fake brand totally ruins the whole thing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote>This update adds “Sidekick”, a feature for exporting data in a format which you can use with mobile devices [&#8230;]</blockquote><p>From the latest <a href="http://barebones.com/products/yojimbo/">YoJimbo</a> release notes, one of my long time favourite OS X applications. The difficulty in getting YoJimbo content onto an iPhone (and impossibility without thinking of it in advance) has been my almost only frustration. Short of syncing with MobileMe to a companion iPhone application this new Sidekick feature is it.</p>



<p>Calling it an export is an understatement. While Sidekick is running (which can be all the time) it maintains an iPhone-friendly, standalone HTML output of all your YoJimbo content under a directory you specify. I&#8217;ve got it exporting to a mounted disk of a password protected web server I can access anywhere.</p>



<p>This leaves one remaining issue with now otherwise perfect software: the lack of a NetNewsWire-like three column view. Thankfully this is easily solved manually with <a href="http://hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/widescreen-hack-for-yojimbo-2">Jon Hicks flawless widescreen hack</a>.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>From the latest spiel Glass has been giving about donations at the opening of every <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/?bypass=true">This American Life podcast</a> for the last few months:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Second question, we get this a lot, why don&#8217;t we just charge for the podcast? The answer is we don&#8217;t want to because fewer people would actually hear the podcast. We like it to be free. Idealistically we like the idea that it should be possible to do ambitious stories and try things that no one else is doing on radio and in podcasts and pay for the whole thing by asking the people who listen to kick in a couple of bucks each. I believe in that. I&#8217;ve thrown money at podcasts I like, it&#8217;s still really cheap entertainment. If that&#8217;s going to be the future of media, I like that future.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>This is the <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/292829693">question I asked</a> five months ago and this answer doesn&#8217;t satisfy me.</p>



<p>Charging for the podcast <em>is</em> asking for money. A future where you can independently  produce original, creative entertainment (or anything) and make a living from it <em>without</em> the need to beg for donations is a future I like.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>For 15 years EP has lived in a perpetual two minute loop of memory:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>I want to take him by the arm and shake him. &#8220;You have a rare and debilitating memory disorder,&#8221; I want to tell him. &#8220;The last 50 years have been lost to you. In less than a minute, you&#8217;re going to forget that this conversation ever even happened.&#8221; I imagine the sheer horror that would befall him, the momentary clarity, the gaping emptiness that would open up in front of him, and close just as quickly. And then the passing car or the singing bird that would snap him back into his oblivious bubble.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>He&#8217;s happy and completely free of worry or anxiety. He&#8217;s not frustrated by his debilitation because he forgets that he forgets.</p>



<p>On the other hand AJ remembers <em>everything</em>:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>I don&#8217;t forgive myself for a lot of things. Your memory is the way it is to protect you. I feel like it just hasn&#8217;t protected me. I would love just for five minutes to be a simple person and not have all this stuff in my head. &#8220;Most people have called what I have a gift,&#8221; AJ says, &#8220;but I call it a burden.&#8221;</p>

</blockquote>



<p>As someone who&#8217;s brain has completely erased the memory of a horrific car accident I am thankful for an appropriately forgetful mind but the opposite extreme, the memory of a goldfish, is equally frightening.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2010/06/04/notes060410.DTL">Behold our dark, magnificent horror</a> by Mark Morford for SF Gate (emphasis mine):</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Because if you&#8217;re honest, no matter where you stand, no matter your politics, religion, income or mode of transport, you see this beast of creeping death and you understand: That is us. The spill may be many things, <strong>but more than anything else it is a giant, horrifying mirror</strong>.</p>

  

  <p>[&#8230;]</p>

  

  <p>As if oil wasn&#8217;t woven like oxygen into every single aspect of American life, as if fully 30 percent of domestic transportation fuel didn&#8217;t come from the gulf, as if shutting down a fraction of those wells wouldn&#8217;t re-devastate the economy, as if petroleum and coal weren&#8217;t powering the very energy plants that deliver the electricity that charges the iPhones that allows everyone to Tweet their angry complaints through all the various energy-sucking server farms the size of a small country.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>I&#8217;ve made a few life decisions with the goal of reducing my personal fossil fuel dependance: sold my car, stopped eating meat but it&#8217;s not enough. Even buying food from the supermarket who have things delivered by thousands of trucks, ships and air planes is participating in the destructive economy of oil dependance.</p>



<p>This man made disaster has affected me deeply and I have to do more if only personally and for my own conscience. Step one has to be owning my own home.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Google love this kind of customisation, it does the same with <a href="https://tools.google.com/chrome/intl/en/themes/index.html">themes for Chrome</a>. <em>None</em> of them are good. Who on earth is demanding these terrible &#8220;features&#8221; and why on earth is Google implementing them!?</p>
